UK Defense Ministry: Russian airstrikes have targeted cities of Lutsk and Ivano- Frankivsk From CNN's Sharon Bral ite in London Russian air and missile forces have conducted strikes against the western Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the past 24 hours the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update on Friday. The staunch resistance of the Ukrainian air defence forces is compelling Russia to rely on 'stand-off' munitions to conduct attacks against targets deep inside Ukraine the ministry said. The ministry added that Russian tactical aircraft supporting ground forces are relying on ""unguided 'dumb' munitions"" which are ""relatively inaccurate and indiscriminate and their use significantly increases the likelihood of civilian casualties. oO
