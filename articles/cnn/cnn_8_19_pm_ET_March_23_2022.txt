Looking for mercenaries around the world. Any scum capable of shooting at civilians” Zelensky said. Russian troops destroy our cities. Kill civilians indiscriminately. Rape women. Abduct children. Shoot at refugees. Capture humanitarian convoys. They are engaged in looting. They burn museums blow up schools and hospitals. The target for them is universities residential neighborhoods ... Anything! Russian troops do not know the limits of evil. Key talks: Zelensky referred to three upcoming meetings with world leaders — the NATO Summit EU Summit and G7 Summit — and said politicians need to support freedom for Ukraine.
