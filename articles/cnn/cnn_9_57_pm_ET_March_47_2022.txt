The Phoenix Mercury star who plays in Russia's Women's Premier League during the WNBA offseason was arrested on Feb. 17 according to US Rep. Colin Allred. According to state-owned RIA Novosti a court advocate said she should be kept under house arrest because their jail beds are a foot (0.3 meters) too short for Griner who is 6’9” (2.05 meters). What we know about her arrest: The location of Griner’s detention has not been publicly revealed. She is in a cell with two others who speak English according to TASS and the court advocate Griner was accused of smuggling hash oil into the country according to RIA Novosti. Her attorneys argued in court Thursday that “the arrest was unlawful and the measure of restraint was unnecessarily severe” RIA reported Consular access: Although a State Department official told CNN the US has been denied consular access to Griner a source close to the situation said Griner’s Russian legal team has seen her several times a week throughout her detention and she is well. The source added the Russian investigation is ongoing a trial date has not been set and Griner’s detention could be extended again in May. Meanwhile Griner’s friends and loved ones in the US are watching the case closely including her former high school coach Debbie Jackson. “I’m hopeful that the US government is working on her behalf and doing everything they can to help” Jackson said. b
