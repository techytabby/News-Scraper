As he noted when it comes to the importance of the global response there is no bigger or smaller country there are only countries that are reacting” Ardern said in a statement. “New Zealand will continue to call on Russia to immediately cease military operations in Ukraine and permanently withdraw to avoid further catastrophic loss of innocent life.” Travel ban: The call comes after New Zealand added an additional 364 Russian political and military targets to a travel ban list on Friday. At the same time 13 individuals and 19 entities were added to a sanctions list which included asset freezes. Those on the list include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. b
