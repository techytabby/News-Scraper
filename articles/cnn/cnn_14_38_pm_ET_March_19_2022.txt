Ina video message posted to Facebook early Sunday the Ukrainian President said Mariupol will go down in history as an example of war crimes.

He said he urged Switzerland to take additional steps such as ensuring Swiss companies that have not yet left the Russian market would do so immediately. “So that they don’t give a single dollar Franc or Euro to the Russian war machine for killing our people. So that all those who are guilty of war against our country will not be able to enjoy life in Switzerland the Swiss real estate and the Swiss banks.” In the Saturday address Zelensky singled out Swiss company Nestle which has not left Russia. “Good food. Good life.’ This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now — when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia"" he said. b
