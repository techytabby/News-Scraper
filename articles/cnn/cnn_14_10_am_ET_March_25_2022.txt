UN nuclear watchdog calls out Russia for shelling areas where Chernobyl power plant staff reside From CNN's Niamh Kennedy in London The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency has called out Russia for shelling areas where staff who work at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant live. In a statement Thursday evening the IAEA said the Ukrainian regulator had informed it that ""Russian forces were shelling Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych where many people working at the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) live.” Slavutych is located outside the exclusion zone that was established in the wake of the infamous 1986 accident at the plant. Ukraine's regulatory authority said the shelling was endangering “the homes and families of those operational personnel that ensure the nuclear and radiation safety” of the Chernobyl NPP which is under the control of Russian forces since 24 February” the statement continued. The UN watchdog's chief Rafael Grossi expressed his concern at the development noting it took place just days after the plant's technical staff were allowed to return home and rest after working for nearly four weeks without a change of shift. oO
