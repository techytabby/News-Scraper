Biden says he believes Russia should be removed from the G20 From CNN's Maegan Vazquez US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he believes Russia should be removed from the Group of 20 and that it’s up to Ukraine to decide whether it's necessary to cede some of its territory in order to reach a ceasefire. “My answer is yes” Biden said during a news conference when asked about whether Russia should be removed. “It depends on the G20. That was raised today and | raised the possibility that if that can't be done - if Indonesia and others do not agree - then we should in my view ask to have both Ukraine be able to attend the meetings as well as ... basically (having) Ukraine being able to attend the G20 meeting and observe.” The White House had previously declined to weigh in publicly on reports that the US and allies want Russia removed from the group but left the door open to the possibility. And following reports this week suggesting Russia may be removed Russia’s ambassador in Jakarta said on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to go” to the G20 summit in Indonesia in November. Also when asked during Thursday's news conference about whether Ukrainian President Zelensky needs to cede any territory in order gain a ceasefire with Russia Biden said it was up to the Ukrainians to decide. “That is a total judgment based on Ukraine. Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. | don’t believe that they're going to have to do that but there is a judgment” Biden said adding that there are discussions taking place that he’s not been part of on the matter. “It's their judgment to make” he added. b
