Ukraine claims another Russian general killed during heavy fighting in southern Ukraine From CNN's Tim Lister A Ukrainian attack on an airfield in the south of the country last week killed a Russian general according to the Ukrainian military's General Staff. Amid heavy fighting between the cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson Ukrainian forces carried out an attack on the airport at Chornobayivka just north of Kherson on Wednesday. The airport was occupied by Russian forces and served as a forward command post of Russia's 8th Guards Combined Arms Army according to Ukrainian officials. Images and video geolocated by CNN showed three helicopters and multiple vehicles on fire at the airport. Soon after the attack Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said ""Burning enemy helicopters in Chornobayivka in the Kherson region is a demonstration of what is now happening to the occupying forces.” Ukraine's General Staff later said “according to preliminary data"" Russian Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev commander of the 8th Guards had been killed. CNN cannot independently verify the Ukrainian claim. Ukraine says that five Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24. oO
