Dmytro Lunin head of the Poltava region administration said that “20000 people left the Sumy region through a green corridor. Buses from Sumy and Trostianets are already arriving in Lubny from where the evacuees will travel by train to the west of the country.” CNN cannot independently verify the number of evacuees but in recent days the Ukrainian authorities have said that tens of thousands of civilians have been evacuated through evacuation corridors from Sumy including hundreds of foreign students. b
