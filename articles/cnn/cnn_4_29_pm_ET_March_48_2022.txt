OSCE investigation into human rights abuses in Russian war in Ukraine is underway From Jennifer Hansler The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)’s investigation into human rights abuses and atrocities committed in the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine is now underway. The fact-finding mission which comes after 45 countries invoked a rare OSCE mechanism that is used to investigate human rights concerns is being led by three experts chosen by Ukraine from an OSCE list of experts. “The mission has already begun and the experts have started their work” said Katya Andrusz the spokesperson for the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). “The mission itself will last around three weeks after which Ukraine will have the opportunity to comment on the report before it’s finalized. An email inbox has been established for people to send information relevant to the fact-finding mission. Andrusz said the inbox has been receiving a lot of information from a variety of sources and it will be open for the entirety of the investigation. The OSCE does not have the authority to legally punish Russia if it finds evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity but their facts can be given to other bodies that do have that authority. The Moscow Mechanism is a serious step and according to the OSCE it has been triggered only nine other times since its establishment in 1991. It was most recently used in 2020 to investigate human rights abuses in Belarus. Russia Ukraine and Belarus are all members of the OSCE. b
