Turkey says Russia's ""unreasonable"" demands of Ukraine will not help ceasefire talks at this point From CNN's Celine Alkhaldl Mostafa Salem and Adam Pourahmadi Turkey says Russia's ""maximalist"" and ""unreasonable"" demands of Ukraine will not help ceasefire talks at this point. The comments come from Turkish presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin who spoke with CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday. Turkey which has a line of communication open with Russia said Putin increasing his military assault on Ukraine will not “realistically” help upcoming negotiations Kalin said “The Russian proposals that came up in the ceasefire negotiations are rather maximalist and not reasonable” said the Turkish spokesperson. “For today to reach an agreement for a ceasefire [Russia's demands] are rather larger political issues that will no help the ceasefire talks at this point” Kalin added. Kalin noted that Turkey remains optimistic for the next round of talks which he said will be over the course of “the next couple of days” but expressed concern over the continuation of the conflict which could have ramifications for years to come. “The first meeting took place yesterday. and there were some good signs and hopefully the next meeting will take place within the next couple of days” Kalin said. Turkey said the issue will be resolved at some point but the impact and consequences from the Russian invasion will be “with us in the years to come.” “we don’t want to exclude anybody and that is why we are keeping lines of communication open with Russia” he added. Highlighting the country’s close economic ties with Moscow Kalin said Turkey has no plans of applying sanctions on Russia. “We are not planning to apply any sanctions to Russia at this point because we don't want our economy to be affected negatively by this” he said. oO
