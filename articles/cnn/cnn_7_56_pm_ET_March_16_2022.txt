(Courtesy AeroVironment) President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday additional US assistance to Ukraine including drones and two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN that specifically the US will be providing Switchblade drones which are small portable so-called kamikaze or suicide drones that carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by AeroVironment. The smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away according to specifications provided by the company while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes. CNN reported earlier today that the Switchblade drones were on Ukraine's wish list of requested military and technological assistance they are still requesting to share with the US government according to two sources familiar with the list These weapons were added to the list after the Ukrainians consulted with congressional partners over the weekend on a draft of the list. The US would have to provide training for the Ukrainian troops if the US gives them those weapons but the sources familiar with the list said that could be done remotely. The company had no comment on the provision of the drones to Ukraine though a statement on AeroVironment’s website says the company “stands with the people of Ukraine and all of NATO.” b
