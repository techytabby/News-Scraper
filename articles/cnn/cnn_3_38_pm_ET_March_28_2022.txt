President Biden says he was ""talking to the Russian people"" when he went off-script From CNN's Jasmine Wright US President Joe Biden said that he was talking to the Russian people when he made the off-the-cuff remark that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” during a speech over the weekend. “| was talking to the Russian people” Biden said when asked on Monday by CNN's Kaitlan Collins why he ad-libbed the line. “The last part of the speech was talking to Russian people” he said. “I was communicating this to not only the Russian people but the whole world. This is this is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. And the way to deal with it is to strengthen and keep NATO completely united and help Ukraine where we can.” Moments before Biden likened the meaning of his comment to a person saying objectively “bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things” and not announcing a change in policy. oO
