In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour Kozyrev said “It’s a barbaric act. Whether | could imagine it when I was the foreign minister it was completely out of question.” “But later on I started to understand that they are going down the hill so to say and they feel impunity both at home and abroad. And that’s kind of increased the appetite unfortunately not for building Russia. Now they are destroying the future of all brotherly people with this fratricidal war” he added. Kozyrev also said sanctions from the West against Russia “should start to target the decision-makers or executers of those decision-makers in the government. He cautioned that sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are “like doing almost nothing — because nothing | think is in their names ... You can’t find their assets. It’s all [with] other people.” On Tuesday Kozyrev took to Twitter calling on all Russian diplomats to resign from their posts in protest of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Kozyrev was the first foreign minister of Russia under Boris Yeltsin after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. b
