Biden: ""We would respond"" if Putin used chemical weapons US President Joe Biden said that the US would respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin used weapons of mass destruction but that the response would depend on the situation. So you've warned about the real threat of chemical weapons being used. Have you gathered specific intelligence that suggests that President Putin is deploying these weapons moving them into position or considering their use? And would the US or NATO respond with military action if he did use chemical weapons?"" the Associated Press asked the US President during his news conference. Biden responded that he could not provide information on intelligence but added on the issue of chemical weapons ""We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of use.” Earlier today NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will reinforce its chemical biological and nuclear defense systems on fears Russia is planning to use such weapons against the people of Ukraine. oO
