FBI says hackers scanned networks of US energy firms ahead of Biden's Russia cyberattack warning From CNN's Sean Lyngaas Hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts the FBI said in a March 18 advisory to US businesses obtained by CNN. The FBI issued the notice days before US President Joe Biden publicly warned that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine and as Western sanctions on the Kremlin begin to bite. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said during Monday's White House briefing that Russia had been conducting preparatory activity"" for cyber attacks which she said could include scanning websites and hunting for software vulnerabilities.” There are at least 18 US companies in other sectors such as defense and financial services that were subjected to the scanning the FBI said. There are no confirmed breaches related to the scanning but the FBI advisory is the latest in a chorus of warnings from US officials to critical infrastructure operators to be on alert for potential Russian hacking. “The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming” Biden told business executives on Monday.  The Russia-based Internet Protocol addresses or data that identifies a computer are “believed to be associated with cyber actors who previously conducted destructive cyber activity against foreign critical infrastructure” the FBI said in its advisory. “This scanning activity has increased since the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict leading to a greater possibility of future intrusions” the FBI memo states. CBS News first reported on the FBI advisory. Read the full story here: RELATED FBI advised that hackers scanned networks of 5 US energy firms ahead of Biden's Russia cyberattack warning b
