In its latest intelligence update the ministry said Russian forces were being prevented from resupplying “forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel” due to their inability to control Ukrainian airspace and challenges on the ground. Russian forces have been reluctant to maneuver across the country the ministry said but did not provide additional details on its knowledge of Russia's strategic moves. “Reluctance to maneuver cross-country lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with basic essentials such as food and fuel” the ministry said “incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to their own supply lines. This is severely limiting Russia's offensive potential.” b
