More fires and destruction in latest satellite images from Mariupol From CNN's Paul P. Murphy ‘A Maxar satelite image shows burning residential apartment buildings in Mariupol Ukraine on March 22. (Maxar/Getty Images) The war is unrelenting in Mariupol where new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show more fires and destruction across the city besieged by the Russian military. Despite Russian-backed troops from Ukraine's Luhansk region taking control of Mariupol's ""left bank"" neighborhood government buildings smoke from fires was still rising from the area in the satellite images which were taken Tuesday morning. These images are some of the only glimpses anyone has into Mariupol as there are reportedly no independent journalists left in the city. Just south of those plumes of smoke a large apartment complex — its facades once white — is seen charred. In the neighborhood's easternmost area half of another apartment building is seen almost completely demolished. In central Mariupol smoke is seen rising from more apartment buildings. Between the ""left bank"" neighborhood and central Mariupol is the Azovstal Metallurgical factory. The images show large holes in some of the buildings in the sprawling factory complex. oO
