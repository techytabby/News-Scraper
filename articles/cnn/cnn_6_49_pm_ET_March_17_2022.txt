Ukraine: 8 of the 9 planned evacuation corridors work as agreed including Mariupol From CNN's Kostan Nechyporenko and Andrew Carey Several cars line up filled with evacuees as they prepare to leave the besieged city of Mariupol Ukraine March 47. (Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters) Eight out of nine agreed evacuation corridors functioned as planned Thursday including one out of Mariupol the Ukrainian government says. The minister responsible Iryna Vereshchuk said almost 800 private cars left Mariupol Thursday with more than 2000 people making it through Russian-occupied territory to the city of Zaporizhzhia by mid-evening. It is the first time in many days that a corridor out of Mariupol had been agreed though Vereshchuk made no mention of whether a planned humanitarian convoy destined for the besieged city had been allowed to leave Berdyansk by Russian forces. Elsewhere 36 tons of food and medicine were delivered to the towns of Hostomel and Bucha to the northwest of Kyiv as well as three villages to the northeast of the capital — areas which have seen some of the worst Russian artillery and rocket fire. One planned corridor between Kharkiv and Vovchansk close to the Russian border failed to operate due to shelling by Russian forces Vereshchuk said. oO
