Russian-installed government ramps up efforts to restore normalcy in Melitopol From CNN's Paul P. Murphy Yulla Shevchenko and Josh Pennington The Russian-installed government in the occupied Ukrainian city of Melitopol is trying to move on with daily life as the invasion rages nearby including restarting schools. Russian-installed mayor Galina Danilchenko also said that power would be restored to a nearby captured Ukrainian air force base ina video message published on Melitopol's Russian-installed government's Telegram channel. But Ivan Fedorov Melitopol's elected mayor claimed that to re-open the schools the government drummed up embezzlement charges against the city's education chief Irina Shcherbak. Fedorov claimed that the charges were brought up because Shcherbak ""refused to cooperate with them"" he said on Instagram. It's not the first time a Melitopol elected official was detained or had charges brought up against them during the Russian occupation. ‘When the Russians installed Danilchenko as Melitopol's new mayor on March 11 she immediately dissolved the elected government and mandated that Russian news be broadcast. Fedorov himself was detained earlier this month by armed men and then charged with terrorism offenses by the Russian-backed rebels prosecutor's office in the Luhansk region. He was later freed as part of a prisoner swap. Fedorov also claims on Instagram that the Russians have cut off all cell phone communications in Melitopol. Danilchenko in a video message claimed that it was the Ukrainians who had cut off communications. Melitopol is located in southern Ukraine between the besieged city of Mariupol and Russian-occupied Kherson.
