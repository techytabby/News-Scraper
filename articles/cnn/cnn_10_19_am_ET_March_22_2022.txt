(Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images) United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres callled for an end to the “absurd war” brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which is causing “appalling human suffering” that has been “intensifying” and becoming “more unpredictable by the hour.” Guterres called the war “un-winnable” and urged for serious negotiation in a briefing from a stakeout podium at UN headquarters in New York City Tuesday. “From my outreach with various actors elements of diplomatic progress are coming into view on several key issues” he said. But as millions of Ukrainians have been forced from their home he said the “war is going nowhere fast.” “Even if Mariupol falls Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city street by street house by house” he said. “There is enough on the table to cease hostilities now ... and seriously negotiate now” he continued. Guterres said “the Ukrainian people are enduring a living hell” and that — particularly for developing countries already feeling the chokehold of Covid-19 recovery — “reverberations are being felt worldwide with skyrocketing food energy and fertilizer prices threatening to spiral into a global hunger crisis.” “How many Ukrainians and Russians will be killed before everyone realizes that this war has no winners — only losers?” he asked. b
