Julianne Smith the US's ambassador to NATO called Biden's surprising comments a ""principled human reaction"" made after he spent the day seeing the firsthand tragedies of war when he visited with hundreds of Ukrainian refugees in a Sunday interview with CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union. “He went to the National Stadium in Warsaw and literally met with hundreds of Ukrainians. He heard their heroic stories as they were fleeing Ukraine in the wake of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. In the moment | think that was a principled human. reaction to the stories that he had heard that day. Still Smith said the ""US does not have a policy of regime change in Russia full stop.” Her comments come hours after Secretary of State Antony Blinken also tried to downplay the President's remarks while in Israel saying ""I think the President the White House made the point last night that quite simply President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else. Asked by Bash to clatify if the US believes Putin should remain in power Smith pivoted to the White House talking point that ""the full administration the President included believes that we cannot empower Putin right now to wage war in Ukraine or pursue these acts of aggression.” Smith did not agree that the quick walk back from White House officials over the President's comments show his aides undermining him on the world stage instead she said officials ""feel great"" about the President's snap trip. b
