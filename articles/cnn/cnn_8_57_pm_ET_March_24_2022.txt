Workers at Chernobyl power plant are being put at risk by Russian shelling in a nearby town IAEA says From CNN's Sahar Akbarzal A Maxar satellite image shows the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine on March 22. (Maxar Technologies) Russian shelling near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has prevented personnel from rotating to and from the plant according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Mariano Grossi. Ukraine's regulatory authority told the IAEA on Thursday that shelling was endangering ‘the homes and families of those operational personnel that ensure the nuclear and radiation safety"" of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The background: Last month Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster and held staff hostage according to Ukrainian officials. Thursday's news comes just days after workers at the power plant were able to finally rotate shifts and go home after working for nearly four weeks without a change of shift. Need for rest and rotating: Grossi had said earlier that Chernobyl staff must be able to rest and rotate stating this is a ""vital element for safe and secure nuclear power operation.” But the Russian bombardment of the city of Slavutych where many of the nuclear plant workers live has put the personnel at risk the IAEA said. Slavutych is located outside of the exclusion zone that was put in place after the 1986 disaster. b
