Murphy Celine Alkhaldi Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie Polglase New videos posted to social media show the horrific aftermath of Russian military strikes that hit an apartment complex in the northem city of Chernihiv on Thursday. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of this and other videos that show the moment of the strikes and the aftermath. ‘One video shows the strike as it happens with residential buildings torn apart in a split second. Sirens echo as the camera shows parts of the building's walls torn open exposing entire apartment rooms. The walls of one apartment complex were reduced to rubble. A fire is seen on the ground with smoke elsewhere still rising from the explosion. The person filming the video moves out into the street which is littered with debris and damaged cars. The video shows an injured woman on the ground beside two people who appear burned and unmoving. ""Kids ... little kids"" she can be heard saying. CNN does not know the condition of the woman seen in the video. Asecond before the military strikes the roar of a projectile is heard on a surveillance video from a nearby house in Chernihiv which shows at least five explosions. Deaths reported: The Ukrainian Emergency Services said on Twitter that as of 6:20 p.m. local time they had pulled 33 bodies from the rubble of the complex in addition to 18 injured people. There are no military facilities nearby only civilian structures like residential buildings and schools the Chernihiv Regional State Administration told CNN. b
