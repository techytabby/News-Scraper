State Department spokesperson: US welcomes ""sentiments"" of hope about diplomacy but Russia must de-escalate From CNN's Jennifer Hansler The United States welcomes “the sentiments expressed that there is hope that there is optimism for diplomatic progress” but believes Russia must de-escalate for any such progress to actually be achieved State Department spokesperson Ned Price said “What Ukraine needs now more than sentiments more than hope more than optimism is de-escalation is an end to the violence is a tangible indication that President Putin is changing course. And that is something we have not yet seen” Price said at a State Department briefing Wednesday referencing “more horrifying reports of shelling of destruction of what appeared to be civilian sites across Ukraine including in Mariupol.” Asked about potential neutrality commitments or other guarantees that could lead to a cessation of the war Price said it was “not a question for us regarding what might lead to a ceasefire a diminution of violence between Ukraine and Russia.” “This is ultimately a question for our Ukrainian partners to decide to decide the terms of diplomacy what they are willing to pursue what they are not willing to pursue” Price said. He said such an issue was “really at the heart of this conflict."" Adding Russia is “waging this war precisely because they sought to deprive Ukraine of its sovereign rights its sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy its sovereign right to determine its own Western orientation its sovereign right to choose its own partners and alliances.” “So as part and parcel of that it is not for us to set the terms by which Ukraine and Russia may be in a position to reach an agreement that we all hope could diminish the violence. That is for Ukrainian to decide. We will be standing by our Ukrainian partners assisting them with the diplomacy as we know a number of our allies and partners around the world are doing but these are questions for sovereign state of Ukraine” Price said. oO
