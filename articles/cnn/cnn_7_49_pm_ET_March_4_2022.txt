The US flew B-52 bombers over NATO's eastern flank on Friday From CNN's From Oren Liebermann The United States flew B-52 Stratofortress bombers over NATO’s eastern flank on Friday exercising with the German and Romanian militaries in a sign of unity as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its second weekend. The largest strategic bombers in the US Air Force took off from RAF Fairford a Royal Air Force station in England and conducted close air support and integration mission training according to a statement from US Air Forces in Europe. The B-52s then flew to Romania where they conducted more close air support training as part of the bomber task force (BTF) missions. The flight over Romanian airspace put the bombers right on the edge of NATO countries adjacent to Ukrainian air space where the Russian air force is trying to establish air supremacy. “BTF rotations give us a critical opportunity to integrate and train with our allies and partners especially during this difficult time” said Gen. Jeff Harrigian commander of United States Air Forces in Europe Air Forces Africa and NATO's Allied Air Command. “Training together ensures the defensive power of NATO remains unmatched” he said. b
