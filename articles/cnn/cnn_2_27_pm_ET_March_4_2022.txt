US energy secretary calls on Russia to allow Ukrainian nuclear operators to work safely From CNN's Liz Stark Us Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted Friday that “Russian forces are in control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant” and called on Russia “to allow the Ukrainian operators to continue to operate safely — including allowing shift changes at both Zaporizhzhia and Chornobyl.” In a series of tweets Granholm also praised Ukrainian operators for being “extremely responsible in how they responded to yesterday's appalling attack by safely taking 2 of the reactors offline.” Granholm noted one reactor is currently “operating at partial capacity to keep the power grid stable.” Granholm also pointed out how the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “is designed to withstand significant shelling or bombardment.” “We have seen no elevated radiation readings overnight. Safety systems are intact and reactors continue to receive cooling” Granholm tweeted. oO
