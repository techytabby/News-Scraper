Biden expresses ""disappointment"" that he can't see the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine firsthand Priests and Poland servicemen prepare for an Orthodox prayer at a refugee center in Nadarzyn near Warsaw Poland on March 25. (Petr David Josek/AP) US President Joe Biden thanked humanitarian organizations in Poland for sending aid to Ukraine and assisting refugees while he is set to receive a briefing on the situation. “I'm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis and quite frankly part of my disappointment is that | can't see it firsthand like | have in other places. They will not let me"" he said. ""Understandably I'm guessing cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine but I'm eager to hear from you in the humanitarian community about what you see what you're doing and where you think we go from here. The humanitarian response is of ""enormous consequence"" Biden said adding that Ukrainians immediately need vital goods like food blankets cash and medicine. The Biden administration yesterday announced the US is committing more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war. About 3.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine according to estimates from the United Nations with the majority of them arriving in Poland. The suffering that's taking place now is at your doorstep. You are the ones risking in some cases your lives ... and the American people are proud to support your efforts” he said. oO
