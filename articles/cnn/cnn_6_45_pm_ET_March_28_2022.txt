(Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters) The Ukrainian general staff said its forces “continue to maintain the circular defense"" inside the port city of Mariupol even as Russian forces consolidated control around the city. The announcement came shortly after midnight on Tuesday. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said earlier Monday that the city was ""in the hands of occupiers” as evacuation corridors from the city have been surrounded on all sides by Russian forces. Boichenko called for ""a complete evacuation” of the remaining citizens from the battered city. Ukrainian officials say 90% of the residential buildings in the city have been damaged or destroyed during the heavy fighting of the last month. oO
