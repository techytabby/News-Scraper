(Efrem Lukatsky/AP) Ukraine's military intelligence head says Russian President Vladimir Putin could be looking to carve Ukraine in two - like North and South Korea. Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanoy the head of Ukraine's Defense intelligence Agency said Russia's operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin’s war was now focused on the south and the east of the country he said. “There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean’ scenario for Ukraine. That is [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine.” Budanov said Russia remained intent on establishing a land corridor from the Russian border to Crimea and said he expected to see an attempt to unite Russian-occupied territories into a single entity. “We are already seeing attempts to create ""parallel"" authorities in the occupied territories and to force people to give up [the Ukrainian] currency” Budanov said adding that he expected Ukrainians to resist Russia's political efforts. b
