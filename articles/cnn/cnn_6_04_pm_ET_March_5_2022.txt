We need to fight every time we have an opportunity.” In a video address posted on his official Facebook page Zelensky said Ukrainians would not give their country “away to an enemy and commended the Ukrainian people's faith. “When you don't have a firearm but they respond with gunshots and you don't run ... This is the reason why occupation is temporary. Our people -- Ukrainians -- don't back down” Zelensky said. Zelensky applauded the Ukrainian people's resistance and protests. They scream at occupants to go home like the Russian battleship pushing the occupants out of our territory” he continued. “Every meter of our Ukrainian land reclaimed by protest is a step forward a step toward victory.” b
