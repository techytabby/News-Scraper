US senators in talks about taking aim at Russia's trade status and changing House bill From CNN's Manu Raju Bipartisan talks in the US Senate are taking shape to take more aggressive action on Russia's trade status — after the White House effectively watered down the Russia bill that passed the House Wednesday night. Initially there had been a bipartisan and bicameral agreement to revoke the ""permanent normal trade relations"" (PNTR) that Russia and Belarus enjoy with the United States. But the White House objected to that language so the bill that passed in the House — which would ban Russian energy imports — instead simply called for a review of Russia's status in the World Trade Organization. Now Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon told CNN that he is engaging in talks with the top tax writers in Congress and the Biden administration about the matter as pressure grows to include tougher language in the House bill when the Senate takes it up — as soon as next week. | believe the Russians — the inhumane behavior of Russia does not justify it get the fruits of the international community"" Wyden told CNN. GOP Sen. Mike Crapo from Idaho the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee said he probably wouldn't support the House bill without stronger language on its trade status — and made clear there would be an effort to amend it. The question is PNTR which is absent. And then they had some other stuff on the WTO in there which is kind of hollow if we don't do PNTR"" Crapo said. ""So | probably would not support it because it doesn't have the key things that you need for a proper trade response. oO
