Teen who escaped Mariupol: ""You know that nowhere is safe  47-year-old Yulia Karpenko describes how she and her family lived in the besieged city of Mariupol. (CNN) Yullia Karpenko 17 and her family lived through winter without heat for weeks in their Mariupol home taking shelter as the port city in southeastern Ukraine came under unrelenting fire by Russian forces. ‘Speaking from Berlin — where she recently escaped to with her mother — the teenager on Thursday described their life under Russia's assault. “On March 2 they tumed off everything but gas — and they turned off gas a few days later” she told CNN. At the time the temperature outside had dropped as low as -7 degrees Celsius (19.4 degrees Fahrenheit). We had to sleep in our jackets and we had five sweaters and T-shirts on and we slept under all the blankets we had — but | was cold anyway"" she said. Karpenko said the family melted snow for water and used candles to light their small shelter while living with the mental stress of constant attacks. I couldn't see my friends | couldn't talk to them I could only talk to my family"" she said ""I's a feeling of helplessness and it's the feeling that you don't know when it ends ... when you don't have anything but the sound of bombings. You're only feeling more and more miserable. You know that nowhere is safe. After she left Mariupol her family's building was directly hit and much of it burned down she said. Videos of the building show “nothing is left"" she added. In Germany Karpenko plans to find a school to attend and pursue higher education. But her stepfather dogs and grandparents are still in Ukraine. ""They didn't want to leave"" she said. b
