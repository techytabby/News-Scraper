Par Pacific Holdings suspends all purchases of Russian crude oil for Hawaii refinery From CNN's Paradise Afshar Par Pacific Holdings headquartered in Houston Texas announced Thursday that they've suspended all purchases of Russian crude oil for their Hawaii refinery. “We intentionally diversify our crude oil sources from locations around the globe to enable us to meet the state's ongoing demand for fuels” Par Pacific Holdings said in a statement. “However in light of recent geopolitical events we have decided to suspend purchases of Russian crude oil for our Hawaii refinery: To meet its fuel production needs Par Pacific Holdings is planning to use “other grades of crude principally from North and South America.” “As the geopolitical situation evolves we will work closely with our customers and partners in state government to make prudent decisions in support of energy assurance for Hawaii” the statement said. Par Pacific Holdings is the parent company of Par Hawaii and Par Hawaii Refining which operates Hawaii's only petroleum refinery in Kapolei according to its website. “For approximately 20-25% of our crude needs we have historically purchased a Russian grade called Sokol which is produced relatively close to Hawaii around the Sakhalin Island north of Japan” Eric Wright the president of Par Hawaii said in a statement. Wright said the decision to suspend Russian crude purchases is not expected to have “significant impacts” on operations in the Kapolei. “Fuel prices are driven primarily by global oil markets” Wright said. “We do not expect our decision to have a meaningful impact on the prices paid by Hawaii consumers.” The average price of regular gas in Hawaii is $4.66 according to AAA and the national average is $3.83. b
