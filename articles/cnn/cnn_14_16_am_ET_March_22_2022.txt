US State Department and St. Jude transport 4 Ukrainian child cancer patients to US for treatment From CNN's Jennifer Hansler The US State Department coordinated with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital to transport four Ukrainian children with cancer to the United States for treatment State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. The children were airlifted from Poland - where the US relocated its diplomats from Ukraine - “to Memphis International Airport where they were met and transported to St. Jude” Price said. “There the patients will be able to safely resume critical cancer therapy disrupted by the Kremlin's aggression. They will receive the specialized care they desperately need and their family members will be afforded sustenance security and support from St. Jude” he said. Price said they recognize that the four children “represent a small proportion of the thousands of patients whose cancer treatment has been interrupted and who even amid a pandemic and with compromised immune systems were forced to flee their homes.” “That is why together with our allies and partners we will continue to support our Ukrainian partners as we seek to save lives and bring this needless war to a close” he said. oO
