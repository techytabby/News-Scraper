(From Telegram) The mayor of Chernihiv said the northern Ukrainian city's cemetery cannot handle all the dead as the Russian onslaught takes its toll on the civilian population. Badly damaged buildings line rubble-strewn streets while still-burning fires fill the air with heavy smoke as seen in a new video from Mayor Viadyslav Atroshenko. The video geolocated and verified by CNN offers an extensive look from the ground at the city that has seen some of the most intense shelling since Russia invaded Ukraine four weeks ago. The city cemetery cannot handle alll the dead so we are keeping people in morgues and refrigerators longer than normal. We are burying people in the old cemeteries that haven't been used in a while"" Atroshenko said in the video while driving through the city's Desnyans'kyi district. When the person recording the video asked how many people have died so far the mayor said the city is not keeping statistics but all cases will be handled by the prosecutor's office. There was a direct strike here. There is a tractor over there burning"" he said. ""We are located right now in the zone of combat.” Driving on Shevchenka street located in the eastern part of the city the mayor looks out at tattered billboards and homes with their roofs blown off or caved in. Look at these neighborhoods. They are completely destroyed. You can clearly see that complete carnage has been unleashed here"" he said.
