Top US general in Europe says anti-tank anti-aircraft weapons most effective for Ukraine — not MiG-29s From CNN's Oren Liebermann The most effective way to support the Ukrainian military is with additional anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons — not MiG-29 fighter jets according to America's top general in Europe. Echoing an earlier statement from Pentagon press secretary John Kirby the commander of US European Command Gen. Tod Wolters said the Ukrainians were “making excellent use of these weapons now"" limiting the ability of Russian military aircraft to operate freely. Wolters added that Ukraine already has “numerous” aircraft flying daily and that adding more would not give the Ukrainian Air Force a relative advantage. “Therefore we assess that the overall gain is low” he said. Any transfer of MiG-29s also risks escalating the conflict he said. Some context: On Tuesday the Pentagon dismissed Poland's proposal to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US for delivery to Ukraine calling it not ""tenable. Kirby said Wednesday the US intelligence community believes transferring MiG-29s to Ukraine now could be seen by Russian President Vladimir Putin as an “escalatory step” that ""could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO. oO
