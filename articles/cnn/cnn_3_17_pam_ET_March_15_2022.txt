This will be a step forward"" says US deputy secretary of state of reports that cars are leaving Mariupol From CNN's Kylie Atwood US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said there are reports of cars leaving Mariupol noting that if this is in fact the beginning of an evacuation corridor such a development would be a “step forward.” “There are reports today that some cars have been let out of Mariupol and that there are other cars waiting to leave Mariupol and if indeed this is the beginning of humanitarian corridor to allow people to escape a city where they have been deprived by the Russians of food and water and medicine and no electricity in a very cold time of year then this will be a step forward” Sherman said on CNN. “But we have a long way to go. The United States wants to do everything we can to support the Ukrainian people and to impose consequences on Vladimir Putin who has done this — this premeditated unjust and unprovoked war of choice to invade Ukraine” she added. Over the weekend Sherman said there were signs that the Russians were beginning to be interested in serious negotiations but she rolled back those comments on Tuesday. She also pointed to her remarks over the weekend where she described Putin’s current focus being on the war itself. “At the end of that paragraph on Sunday | also said so far Vladimir Putin has not shown any sign but that he wants to continue this war of carnage. So unfortunately | think any of those little signs have disappeared” Sherman said adding that getting cars out of Mariupol would be a positive step forward. oO
