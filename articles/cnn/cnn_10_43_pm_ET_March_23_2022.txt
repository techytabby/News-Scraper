The target of aggressors is the capital of Ukraine” the mayor said in a video on his YouTube channel Wednesday. The bombardment of Ukraine by Russian forces began one month ago. Before the war about 3 million people lived in Kyiv but the population has now dwindled to about half that because of how many people have fled Klitschko said. “We need support right now in this very difficult time” he said. “Everybody's surprised how tough Ukrainian army how tough Ukrainian soldiers (are) because we stand in front one of the strongest armies in the world: the Russian army. Klitschko said Ukrainians are “so tough"" because unlike Russian soldiers they are fighting to defend their children their families their city and their future. Russia he said wants to rebuild its empire but Ukraine wants ""to be part of the European family as a democratic modern European country of Ukraine.” b
