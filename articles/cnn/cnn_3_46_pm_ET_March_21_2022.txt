(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) US President Joe Biden on Monday urged private sector partners “to harden your cyber defenses immediately” pointing to “evolving intelligence” indicating “the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States” While pledging his administration would “continue to use every tool to deter disrupt and if necessary respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure” the President in a statement acknowledged “the Federal Government can’t defend against this threat alone.” “Most of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks.” Among steps the administration is recommending to protect against cyber-attacks are the use of multifactor authentication consulting with cybersecurity professionals to make sure systems are patched and protected against all known vulnerabilities changing passwords across networks to prevent stolen credentials from being used backing up and encrypting data and educating employees on cyber security. “From day one my Administration has worked to strengthen our national cyber defenses mandating extensive cybersecurity measures for the Federal Government and those critical infrastructure sectors where we have authority to do so and creating innovative public-private partnerships and initiatives to enhance cybersecurity across all our critical infrastructure” Biden wrote. “Congress has partnered with us on these efforts — we appreciate that Members of Congress worked across the aisle to require companies to report cyber incidents to the United States Government.” oO
