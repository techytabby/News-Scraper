New drone video shows flooding in Kyiv region's Irpin River From CNN's Paul P. Murphy New drone video near the Ukrainian village of Rakivka shows flooding in the Irpin River basin northwest of Kyiv. For days satellite images have shown rising water levels of the Irpin River. Now new drone video is giving a better glimpse of just how far south flooding has spread. CNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video. It was published on Tuesday but its metadata shows the video file was created on Monday. The video also shows a Russian tank firing toward the eastern bank of the Irpin River. The Russian military controls much of the western bank of the Irpin River around Rakivka; the Ukrainian military is dug in and is defending northwestern Kyiv around Moshchun. Why this matters: The river is critical to the Russian advance toward Kyiv; if the Russians cannot cross it they can't take Kyiv from the west. It's unclear how the dam began flooding — whether the gates were opened on purpose by the Ukrainians or it was hit by a military strike. Watch the video: ocr leae
