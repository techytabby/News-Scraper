UN human rights chief: Russia's indiscriminate attacks ""may amount to war crimes From CNN's Richard Roth Russia's indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and “may amount to war crimes” UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva Wednesday. Bachelet said her investigators are looking into 24 cases where cluster munitions were used by Russia. Hospitals water supplies and administrative buildings have been struck by missiles or shelling she reported. “The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to” she said. The Ukrainian people are enduring a “living nightmare” Bachelet added. “The hostilities must stop without delay” Bachelet said. “Today | call on the Russian Federation to heed the clear and strong calls of the General Assembly and of this Council and immediately act to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory.” oO
