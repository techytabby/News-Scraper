Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv and failed in its objective of subjugating all of Ukraine but it can still inflict massive brutality on the country including Kyiv"" the official said. Biden said he and European leaders he spoke with Tuesday morning agreed to wait and see what Russia had to offer while watching their actions in the meantime. b
