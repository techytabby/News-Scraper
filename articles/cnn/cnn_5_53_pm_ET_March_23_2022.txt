Russian-proposed draft resolution on the Ukraine humanitarian situation fails to pass in UN Security Council From CNN's Richard Roth and Laura Ly A Russian-proposed draft resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine failed to pass in the United Nations Security Council Wednesday evening. Two countries voted in favor zero countries voted against and 13 countries including the United States abstained from the vote. Nine votes in favor were required for the resolution to pass. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke ahead of the vote stating that Russia was once again trying to use the Security Council to “provide cover for its brutal actions.” “tt really is unconscionable that Russia would have the audacity to put forward a resolution asking the international community to solve a human crisis that Russia alone created” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia does not care about the deteriorating humanitarian conditions or the millions of lives and dreams the war has shattered. if they cared they would stop fighting.” The US ambassador added that Russia's resolution “makes no mention of its role as the sole cause of this crisis. And our vote [of abstention] will show that we will play no part in that.” Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia also spoke ahead of the vote Wednesday evening claiming that their draft resolution was “analogous to other draft humanitarian resolutions.” b
