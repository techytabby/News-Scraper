On Sunday Bolsonaro refused to sanction Moscow and insisted Brazil would ""adopt a neutral stance"" on the invasion pointing to his country's reliance on Russian fertilizer for its agriculture. Afterward Brazil's Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Franga clarified that Bolsonaro had meant to use the word ""impartiality. Speaking during a news conference at Ukraine's Embassy in Brasilia Tuesday Ukrainian diplomat Anatoliy Tkach said Kyiv had not received any word of solidarity from Bolsonaro. “We know who the aggressor is. There are victims. | don't understand how impartiality can apply in this situation"" he said. Tkach also warned that maintaining ties with Russia at this time could lead to indirect financing of the war against Ukraine. “We call on everyone to cut all trade ties with Russia. All ties. Doing business with Russia now means funding aggression war crimes disinformation cyber attacks and even Russian leader Vladimir Putin” he said. b
