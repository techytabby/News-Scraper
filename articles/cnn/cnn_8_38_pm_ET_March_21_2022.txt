Instead of soul. Instead of everything that makes human human. Without offering evidence Zelensky also claimed Russian troops hit the Zhytomyr region with rockets Tuesday and that a Russian aircraft was shot down in the Kharkiv region near Chuhuiv. “Our military has already shot down so many Russian planes and helicopters that one can only wonder what do their pilots have instead of mind? Is it also emptiness?"" he said. Zelensky also said in Kherson ""the occupiers shot at people who peacefully took to the streets without weapons at a rally for their freedom. For our freedom. The Russian soldiers do not even know what it is like to be free. They were driven here to be honest as if sentenced. Sentenced to death sentenced to disgrace.” Zelensky added that civilians also came under fire in the Zaporizhzhia region. ""Four children were hospitalized. Two are in grave condition"" he said. The President thanked everyone who worked to help evacuation corridors saying more than 8000 people were rescued Monday. ""Thank you to everyone who did it who worked for the people.
