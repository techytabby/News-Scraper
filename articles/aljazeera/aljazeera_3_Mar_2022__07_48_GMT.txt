Multiple explosions rock the capital At least four major blasts were heard in Kyiv in the early hours of this morning with footage shared on social media showing the night sky lit up by explosions. It remains unclear what the targets were or whether anyone was hurt or wounded amid the incidents. They came after an earlier explosion near Kyiv’s central train station which a Ukrainian official said was caused by falling wreckage from a Russian missile that was downed by the country’s air defences. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said there were no casualties as a result of that incident.
