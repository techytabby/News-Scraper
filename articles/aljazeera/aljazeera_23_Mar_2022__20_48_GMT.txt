First shipment from US's $800m arms package to be sent to Ukraine this week The first shipment from the US’s $800m arms package for Ukraine will be shipped in the next day or so and will not take long to reach Ukraine a senior US defence official has said. The official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity did not specify which systems would be included in the first shipments to Ukraine but said priority would be given to the kinds of defensive weapons already being used by Ukrainian troops. “We are already aggregating stocks in the United States and we're getting ready to ship them over there” the official said.
