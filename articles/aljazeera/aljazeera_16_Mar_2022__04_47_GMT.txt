China says Taiwan ‘taking advantage’ of Ukraine China’s government has lambasted Taiwan’s humanitarian aid for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia as “taking advantage of others’ difficulties” after the self-ruled territory announced it was sending more funds donated by the public for refugees. The war in Ukraine has garnered broad sympathy in Taiwan with many seeing parallels between Russia’s invasion and the military threat posed by China which views the democratically governed island as its own territory. Asked about Taiwan’s aid and sanctions at a news conference in Beijing Zhu Fenglian a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said: “The Democratic Progressive Party authorities are using the Ukraine issue to validate their existence and piggyback on a hot issue” referring to Taiwan’s ruling party.
