Dnipro attack ‘to have ripple effect’ Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid said the aerial attack on Dnipro took place at about 6:15am local time (04:15 GMT) targeting an industrial complex in Ukraine’s third-largest city. Reporting from near the site she said police had blocked access to it as a search for unexploded ordnance was ongoing. “We do know that a heavy machinery factory was hit along with what was described as a coal-enhancing factory and a third location next to the kindergarten” Abdel-Hamid added. “This is the first time this city is targeted since the beginning of the war. Many people were expecting this to happen saying it was not a matter of if but when” she said noting that the attack was “certainly going to have a ripple effect on the people living here”.
