Abramovich puts Chelsea up for sale Russian businessman Roman Abramovich has said he will sell Chelsea Football Club amid calls for the metals magnate to be hit by sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich said he told his aides to set up a charitable foundation which would receive all net proceeds from the sale. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine” Abramovich said in the statement.
