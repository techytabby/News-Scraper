Zelenskyy accuses Russian forces of ‘direct strike’ on Mariupol hospital complex Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of carrying out a “direct strike” on a hospital complex in Mariupol that reportedly houses maternity and children’s wards. “People children are under the wreckage” Zelenskyy tweeted calling the attack an “atrocity”. “How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity” he added. Zelenskyy also shared footage from the scene of the alleged attack which appeared to show several wrecked rooms along a corridor in a building that had blown-out windows. Outside of the building a square carpeted with rubble and debris could be seen. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the footage.
