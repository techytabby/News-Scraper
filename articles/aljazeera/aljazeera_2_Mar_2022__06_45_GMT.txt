Asked by radio station Deutschlandfunk what the government would do if Russia stops gas exports Habeck replied: “We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer.” “For the next winter we would take further measures” he added pointing to planned new legislation to ensure gas storage is full for winter. “So we are also taking precautions for the worst case which has not happened yet because the Russians are delivering” he said adding that in a worse-case scenario Berlin could keep “coal-fired power plants in reserve maybe even keep them running” but that it was committed to moving to renewables in the medium term.
