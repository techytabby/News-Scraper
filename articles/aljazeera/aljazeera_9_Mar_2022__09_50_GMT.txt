She added the situation elsewhere in the country was unclear despite Ukraine’s announcement of six exit routes. “Whether or not that actually happens and the fighting stops is another matter indeed” Butler said. “All we know for the time being is that Russian officials did earlier make an offer of putting in place humanitarian corridors but so far those offers which have been repeated over the past few days have meant that people could flee not to Western Ukraine or neighbouring countries but to Russia and Belarus” she added noting Ukrainian authorities had emphatically rejected such plans.
