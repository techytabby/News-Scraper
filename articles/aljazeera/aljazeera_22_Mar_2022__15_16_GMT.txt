Ukraine says 100000 civilians want to escape Mariupol but cannot Ukraine’s deputy prime minister says at least 100000 civilians want to escape from Mariupol but cannot because of a lack of safe corridors out of the besieged southeastern port city. Iryna Vereshchuk said shelling by Russian forces was also preventing rescue workers from accessing the site of a bombed theatre in Mariupol where city officials say hundreds were believed to be sheltering underground when it was hit by an air raid last week. Russia has denied bombing the theatre or attacking civilians.
