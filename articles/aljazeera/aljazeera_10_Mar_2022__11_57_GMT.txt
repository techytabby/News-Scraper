In apparent first China's foreign minister calls Ukraine conflict a ‘war’ China’s foreign minister has publicly described the situation in Ukraine as a “war” in what appears to be Beijing’s first official use of the word in relation to the conflict. “We hope to see fighting and the war stop as soon as possible” state broadcaster CCTV quoted Wang Yi as saying in talks via video link with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian. Beijing has so far attempted to strike a delicate balancing act over Moscow’s incursion refusing to condemn or condone Russia's actions while signaling a willingness to mediate between it and Ukraine.
