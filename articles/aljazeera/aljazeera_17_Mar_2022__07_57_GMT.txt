Losses mount in Chernihiv: Governor The bodies of 53 residents of Chernihiv have been delivered to the embattled city’s morgue after heavy bombardment and shelling according to a Ukrainian defence official. “We suffer great losses” regional administrator Vyacheslav Chaus said in a video posted on Facebook. “We will avenge and kill for every citizen we lost.” The northern Ukrainian city of 280000 lies close to the border with Moscow-friendly Belarus which was used as a springboard for the Russian invasion that began on February 24. The city has a sizable ethnic Russian minority.
