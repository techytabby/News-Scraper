Ukraine says Russian shelling disrupts evacuation of Izyum Aplanned evacuation of civilians from the Ukrainian town of Izyum in the eastern Kharkiv region has been held up by Russian shelling according to the region’s governor. An evacuation route from Izyum to Lozova was one of the six humanitarian corridors announced by Kyiv earlier on Wednesday but Oleh Synehuboy said buses were still waiting at the entrance to the town and hence had not been able to ferry people out. He added that negotiations with the Russians were under way with the support of the Red Cross.
