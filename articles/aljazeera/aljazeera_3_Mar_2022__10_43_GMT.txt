Russian foreign minister claims Moscow ‘looking after its own security interests’ Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari reporting from Moscow says Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is adamant that Moscow is “looking after its own security interests” amid its invasion of Ukraine. “He said the world was listening to Russia but he was not sure if it is hearing what the Russians are saying” Jabbari said citing comments Lavrov made during an online interview with Russian and foreign media. “[And] he was adamant about his country’s position — that they are really under threat from neighbouring countries that are part of NATO” she added. Jabbari said that Lavrov made clear Russia was “still very much open to the idea of dialogue with NATO as well as the United States” despite ties between Moscow and the West plunging to new lows over Moscow’s actions.
