NATO begins planning to reset military posture on eastern flank NATO is set to tell its military commanders to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine including more troops and missile defences in Eastern Europe according to officials and diplomats. Defence ministers from the alliance will order the military advice at NATO headquarters on Wednesday just over a week before allied leaders including US President Joe Biden gather in Brussels on March 24. “We need to reset our military posture for this new reality” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. “Ministers will start an important discussion on concrete measures to reinforce our security for the longer term in all domains.”
