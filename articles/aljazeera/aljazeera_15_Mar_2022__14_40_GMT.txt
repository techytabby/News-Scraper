Belarus resisting attempts to drag it into Ukraine conflict: Lukashenko President Alexander Lukashenko has said Belarus intercepted a missile fired at it two days ago from Ukraine but that it would resist what he called attempts to draw it into the conflict across the border. The Kyiv government accused Russia on Friday of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse for Moscow's close ally which has served as a staging post for Russian forces to join the conflict. “I want to emphasise again ... We are not going to become involved in this operation that Russia is conducting in Ukraine” Lukashenko told Belarusian soldiers according to the state news agency BelTA.
