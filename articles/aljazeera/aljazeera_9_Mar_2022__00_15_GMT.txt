Poland's jet offer for Ukraine ‘not tenable’ says US The Pentagon has appeared to dismiss Poland’s offer to give its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US so they can be passed to Ukraine. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the prospect of jets departing from a US/NATO base in Germany “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance”. “We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one” he added.
