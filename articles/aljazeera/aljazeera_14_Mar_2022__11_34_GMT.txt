Greece Ukraine discuss plight of war-hit ethnic Greeks Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says he has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the “dramatic” conditions facing Greece’s ethnic minority in war-hit southeastern Ukraine. The two leaders discussed “the need to open a humanitarian corridor for safe exit and access for humanitarian supplies” the Greek PM’s office said in a statement. Greece’s consul general in Mariupol is among those trapped in the city Mitsotakis said. Athens last month said nearly a dozen members of the Greek minority of over 100000 dating to the 18th century had died blaming Russian attacks.
