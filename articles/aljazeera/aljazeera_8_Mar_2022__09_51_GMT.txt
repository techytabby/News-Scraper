UN rights chief decries clampdown on anti- war protests in Russia Michelle Bachelet the UN’s human rights chief has warned Moscow's response to widespread demonstrations against its invasion signals a narrowing of freedoms in the country. “T remain concerned about the use of repressive legislation that impedes the exercise of civil and political rights and criminalising non- violent behaviour” Bachelet told the Human Rights Council in Geneva via video link. More than 13500 people have been arrested for taking part in a string of anti-war protests held in dozens of cities throughout Russia since it began its offensive according to protest monitoring group OVD-Info.
