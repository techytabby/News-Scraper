WHO confirms additional attacks on healthcare infrastructure There have been at least seven attacks on Ukraine's healthcare infrastructure since the beginning of Russia’s offensive according to the World Health Organization (WHO). “As of 7 March nine verified incidents of attacks on health care in Ukraine have been published on the Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare (SSA) seven with ‘Confirmed’ certainty level and two with ‘Possible’ certainty level” a WHO official told the Reuters news agency in an email referring to the organisation’s database. The number of verified attacks was up from four the previous day. The official gave no information on the perpetrators of the incidents since the WHO surveillance system has no mandate to collect information on them.
