IAEA concerned about Chornobyl safety despite reparations The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern over the safety of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) despite news of the resumption of external electricity supplies following the reparation of a damaged power line. “This is a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now” IAEA Director General Grossi said. “However I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine’s other nuclear facilities.” The plant is working on back-up diesel generators and will be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity grid in the morning on Monday according to IAEA. The UN nuclear watchdog also said staff operating radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl had stopped carrying out safety-related repairs due to exhaustion since they have not been relieved since Russia seized the site last month.
