Russia says it boycotted ICJ hearing because of ‘absurd’ lawsuit Russia's foreign ministry has said Moscow boycotted a hearing this week at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over a lawsuit brought by Ukraine because of the “absurdity” of the case. Ukraine on Monday requested that the UN’s top court order Russia to halt its offensive arguing Moscow had wrongly tried to justify its invasion on false assertions. The ICJ based in The Hague has said it will rule on the case “as soon as possible”. Russia is not expected to comply with any decision ordering it to stop its attack.
