US gasoline hits record $4.17 The average price of gasoline in the US has hit a record $4.17 per gallon as the country announced a ban on Russian oil imports. The national average rose by 10 cents per gallon in one day up 55 cents since last week according to AAA data. The previous high was set 13 years ago when the national average price hit $4.10 per gallon. US lawmakers were discussing ways to ease the impact of the ban on energy prices. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett reporting from Washington said the White House had been reluctant to put the ban in place because of the impact on American consumers. The price of petrol is expected to climb significantly. “The president said prices could go up by at least 75 cents a gallon” Halkett said. “That’s a lot considering that Americans are paying some of the highest prices for consumer goods and given the fact that inflation is at the highest we've seen in 40 years.” AOA ATel MMT Be)!” i= v eter SUS Rola lad Pp poe INSIDE* Ei TORY® ALJAZBERA ] re) -)*) [oem ten-year high |)
