UK warns against post-Ukraine reset with Putin The West must not try to “normalise relations” with Russian President Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said calling the crisis a “turning point for the world”. “There are some around the world ... who say that we're better off making accommodations with tyranny ... I believe they are profoundly wrong” the British leader told his Conservative Party’s Spring conference in Blackpool northwest England. “To try to renormalise relations with Putin after this as we did in 2014 would be to make exactly the same mistake again and that is why Putin must fail.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions at the parliament in London January 19 2022 in this screen grab taken from a video [File: Reuters]
