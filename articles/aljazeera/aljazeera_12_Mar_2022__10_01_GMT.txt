Israel not pushing Ukraine to yield to Russian demands Ukraine adviser says A top Ukrainian adviser has pushed back against suggestions Israel tried to nudge Ukraine into caving to Russian demands during talks. Israel “just as other conditional intermediary countries does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. “This is impossible for military & political reasons. On the contrary Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately.” Israel has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to try to end the war in Ukraine. A report in Israel's Walla news and Jerusalem Post had suggested citing an unidentified Ukrainian official that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had urged Ukraine to give in to Russia.
