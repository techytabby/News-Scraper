China ‘should put some pressure on Russia’: Ukraine presidential adviser An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine hopes China will realise that it “should put some pressure on Russia” to end the war. Alexander Rodnyansky told Al Jazeera that doing so would help China “establish a more viable relationship with the rest of the world” in the long term. “And that’s clearly more important to them than supporting Russia which has isolated itself and is clearly in decline at this point.”
