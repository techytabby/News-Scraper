Ukraine's international legion swells after Zelenskyy's appeal About 20000 people from more than 50 different countries have volunteered to serve in Ukraine’s new international legion fighting force according to Kyiv after Zelenskyy publicly urged foreigners to sign up to defend his country. Jay a Portuguese national is among them. He has left his home in London to take up arms against Russia's forces saying he was motivated by a “lack of action” from Western powers in response to Moscow’s invasion. “T personally don’t think sanctions are enough I understand the fear of World War III but this is the beginning of World War III” Jay who declined to give his surname told Al Jazeera in the Polish village of Korezowa on the country’s border with Ukraine. “T don’t think I’m being brave I’m just doing what I would like people to do if the United Kingdom was under attack and [Prime Minister] Boris Johnson was appealing for help.”
