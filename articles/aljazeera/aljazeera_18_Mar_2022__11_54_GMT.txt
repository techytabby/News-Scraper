Italy investigates Russia's Kaspersky antivirus software Italy’s data privacy watchdog has said it is investigating the “potential risks” that Russian antivirus software Kaspersky could be used to launch cyberattacks. It followed what it called “alarms sounded by many Italian and European organisations specialised in computer security” over the potential use of Kaspersky software for hacking assaults. The watchdog has asked the company to provide details on the number and profile of its Italian customers and whether users’ personal data is “transferred outside the European Union” to Russia or elsewhere.
