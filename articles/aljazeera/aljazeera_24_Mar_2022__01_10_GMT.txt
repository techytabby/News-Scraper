Australia concerned over Putin's plans to attend G20 meeting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he has been raising concerns about Putin’s plans to attend the next G20 summit in Indonesia this year. “The idea of sitting around a table with Vladimir Putin who the United States are already in the position of calling out [for] war crimes in Ukraine for me is a step too far” Morrison said during a media briefing.
