Orchestra holds open-air concert in central Kyiv Members of the Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra have held an open- air concert in the Ukrainian capital’s Independence Square. Dozens of people brazed freezing temperatures to gather for the impromptu musical offering which included a rendition of the national anthem and an excerpt from Beethoven’s Ode to Joy on which the European Union’s anthem is based. Some of those in attendance waved Ukrainian flags while conductor Herman Makarenko told reporters that the concert was a call for peace. “We would like to support our president ... who called calls and will call to all governments of the world [to] stop the war in Ukraine” Makarenko was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. His efforts came against the backdrop of wailing air raid sirens and soldiers searching cars at checkpoints on main thoroughfares — stark reminders that the city is firmly on a war footing. Makarenko said he managed to gather around 20 musicians for the performance instead of the 65-70 who normally comprise the ensemble [Gleb Garanich/Reuters]
