‘The city is destroyed’: Mariupol police officer Russian forces have pushed deeper into Ukraine’s besieged and battered port city of Mariupol where heavy fighting shut down a big steel plant and local authorities pleaded for more help.

The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth” Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said on Saturday from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders.
