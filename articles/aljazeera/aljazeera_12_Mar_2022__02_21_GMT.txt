UN experts say Russian media law amounts to information ‘blackout’ A Russian law giving Moscow stronger powers to crack down on independent journalism is placing Russia under a “total information blackout” on the war in Ukraine UN independent experts have said. Moscow last week blocked Facebook and other websites and passed a law that imposed a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. “Russia’s recent adoption of a punitive ‘fake war news’ law is an alarming move by the government to gag and blindfold an entire population” three independent UN experts appointed by the top UN rights body the Human Rights Council said in a statement. ” .. the law places Russia under a total information blackout on the war and in so doing gives an official seal of approval to disinformation and misinformation” they continued.
