Putin unlikely to provoke NATO to enter war: US analyst Russia President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to provoke NATO forces to enter the war in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to suffer logistics and organisational failures said Lauren Speranza a director at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington DC. “T do think he would be hesitant to actually fully escalate this war to bring in NATO” Speranza told Al Jazeera. “There is no successful political or military endgame for Russia.” A war involving NATO “would be disastrous for Mr Putin perhaps even more so than the war that’s already going on in Ukraine” she added.
