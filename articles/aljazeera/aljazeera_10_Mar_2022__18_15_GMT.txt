EU leaders set to agree on phasing out Russian fuels European Union leaders are set to agree to cut their reliance on Russian fossil fuels although are divided over whether to cap gas prices and to sanction oil imports. As part of a two-day summit in Versailles France the leaders are expected to agree to the phasing out of Russian oil gas and coal according to a draft statement which gives no end-date.
