Evacuation routes ‘point in the direction of Belarus Russia’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull reporting from Lviv says there is “no independent verification whatsoever” that Russia is in fact observing a ceasefire to allow for civilian evacuations. “Significant points of caution need to be applied to what is going on here on the one hand because there is no Ukrainian confirmation that it is in any way involved in these corridors” Hull said. “The previous two attempts [at evacuation] out of Mariupol were the result of joint agreement between the two sides that came out of ceasefire talks. This looks much more like a unilateral Russian act and indeed a Ukrainian presidential spokesperson has called these actions immoral” he added. “Because and this is the second point of caution the routes of evacuation being laid out by the Russian ministry of defence point in the direction of Belarus and Russia — which raises the very obvious question just how many Ukrainians under Russian bombardment knowing that would actually make use of them.” What is Putin's endgame in Ukraine? | UpFront WHY DID PUTIN™ INVADE UKRAINE 2g
