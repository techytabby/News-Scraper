US China aides to meet amid tensions over Russia The US and China are sending top aides to meet in Rome on Monday amid mounting tensions between the two countries over the Russia- Ukraine war with the US saying Russia has asked China for military equipment to help press its campaign. In advance of the talks White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and the European Union. China needs access to those markets yet it also has shown support for Moscow joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.
