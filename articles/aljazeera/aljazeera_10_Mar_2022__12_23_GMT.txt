Turkish foreign minister says Lavrov- Kuleba meeting was ‘civil’ Turkey’s foreign minister has described Lavrov and Kuleba’s meeting as “civil” and said the most important outcome of the talks which failed to produce any ceasefire agreement was establishing high-level contact between both sides. Speaking at a news conference after the meeting Mevlut Cavusoglu said there was a need for both a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to allow for civilians to be evacuated from the city and for a sustainable ceasefire in Ukraine. “The meeting was an important start. No one should expect miracles at one meeting” he told reporters. Cavusoglu brokered the talks between Lavrov and Kuleba as Ankara pushes to position itself as a mediator in the conflict.
