US Congress to ‘explore’ Russian oil ban: Pelosi US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the chamber is “exploring” legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10bn in aid for Ukraine in response to Russia's military invasion of its neighbour. “The House is currently exploring strong legislation that will further isolate Russia from the global economy” Pelosi said in a letter. “Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organisation.” Residential areas shelled:in Zhytomyr Residential areas shelled in Ukraine's Zhytomyr
