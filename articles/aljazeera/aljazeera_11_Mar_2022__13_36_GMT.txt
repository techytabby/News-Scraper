UN says 564 civilians killed in Ukraine The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) has confirmed the deaths of 564 civilians in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began including 41 children. OHCHR added the real toll is thought to be considerably higher since it has not yet been able to corroborate reports from areas where intense fighting is ongoing. “Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas” it said. “These include missiles heavy artillery shells and rockets as well as air strikes.” UN Human Rights @ vw @UNHumanRights @™#Ukraine: We remain gravely concerned by rising death toll & human suffering from apparent indiscriminate #Russian attacks which may amount to war crimes. We call for an immediate end to the attacks: ow.ly/vYLt5OIlgXx0  4:11 AM- Mar 11 2022 @ QO 722. OD Reply & Copylink Read 167 replies
