UN chief calls for end to ‘absurd war’ UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an end to the “absurd war” in Ukraine warning that the conflict is “going nowhere fast” and that the Ukrainian people are “enduring a living hell”. “Continuing the war in Ukraine is morally unacceptable politically indefensible and militarily nonsensical” Guterres told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York.
