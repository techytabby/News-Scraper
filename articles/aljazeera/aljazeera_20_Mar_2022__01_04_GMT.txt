Anger after Johnson compares resistance in Ukraine with Brexit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sparked outrage by comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to people in the United Kingdom voting for Brexit. In his speech to a conference of his Conservative Party in the coastal town of Blackpool Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country like the people of Ukraine to choose freedom” with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”. Former European Council President Donald Tusk said the prime minister’s words “offend Ukrainians [and] the British and common sense” while former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said the comparison was “insane”. A Donald Tusk @ v : @donaldtuskEPP Boris Johnson likens Ukrainians’ fight to British people voting for Brexit. | can still remember the enthusiasm of Putin and Trump after the referendum. Boris your words offend Ukrainians the British and common sense. 9:18 AM - Mar 19 2022 @ O 1132K © Reply & Copy link Read 5.1K replies Conservative peer Gavin Barwell also criticised Johnson pointing out that Ukraine is seeking to join the European Union and adding that voting in the 2016 referendum “isn’t in any way comparable with risking your life” in a war with Putin’s forces. Gavin Barwell @ v @GavinBarwell Apart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn't in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion + the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU this comparison is bang on Ben Quinn @ @8enQuinn75 Boris Johnson compares Ukraine's fight for freedom to “the British people voting for Brexit “in large numbers’ “it was because they wanted to be free to do things differently for this country to be able to do things differently and run itself” 7:37 AM - Mar 19 2022 @ QO 16K © Reply & Copy link Read 131 replies
