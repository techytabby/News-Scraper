Kyiv's residents ‘holding their breath for what's coming next’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen reporting from Kyiv says people in the capital are “very well aware ... [it] is the main prize in this war”. “There’s been a very eerie silence people who are still in the city are holding their breath for what's coming next” Vaessen said. Vaessen said there was an ‘eerie silence’ inKyivas._ “But this silence has been the city braces for a possible large-scale Russian interrupted in the last assault [Al Jazeera] hour by artillery fire coming from the northeast of the city. We know there’s also heavy fighting in the northwest — ifa bridge in the town of Irpin falls into the hands of Russian troops then the next stop will be Kyiv” she added. Vaessen described a palpable feeling of “tension fear and stress” in the city among those who had opted not to flee and are now readying to defend it from an anticipated Russian attack. “They have put up barricades with whatever they could find and there are checkpoints everywhere” she said. “The Russian advance to the capital has been stalled in the last week but there [are fears] the advance — and even heavy bombardment — on Kyiv could happen in the next few days.”
