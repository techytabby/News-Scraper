Poland proposes total EU ban on trade with Russia: PM Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says Poland has proposed to the European Union that the bloc impose a total ban on trade with Russia. “Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible (including) both of its seaports... but also a ban on land trade. Fully cutting off Russia’s trade would further force Russia to consider whether it would be better to stop this cruel war” Morawiecki said. Earlier this week EU member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia. Details were not disclosed but the French presidency said Russia’s “most-favoured nation” trade status would be revoked.
