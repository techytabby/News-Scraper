Zelenskyy says Russia sanctions not sufficient Zelenskyy has appealed to the West to strengthen sanctions on Russia. In a video statement the Ukrainian president criticised Western leaders for not responding to the Russian defence ministry's earlier announcement that it would attack Ukraine’s military-industrial complex.  “I didn’t hear even a single world leader react to this” Zelenskyy said. “The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient.” Zelenskyy also called for organising a “tribunal” to bring to justice those who order and carry out such crimes. “Think about the sense of impunity of the occupiers that they can announce such planned atrocities” he said. The Russian defence ministry had said its forces intend to attack Ukraine’s military-industrial complex with what it said were “precision” weapons and urged staff to leave in a statement carried by the Russian state news agency Tass.
