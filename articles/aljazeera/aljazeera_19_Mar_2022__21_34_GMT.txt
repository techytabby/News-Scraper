Ukrainian refugees seek ID cards in Poland Hoping to restore some normalcy after fleeing the war in Ukraine thousands of refugees waited in long lines on Saturday in the Polish capital Warsaw to get identification cards that will allow them to get on with their lives — at least for now. Refugees started queueing by Warsaw's National Stadium overnight to get the coveted PESEL identity cards that will allow them to work live go to school and get medical care or social benefits for the next 18 months. By mid-morning many were told to come back another day. The demand was too high even though Polish authorities had simplified the process.
