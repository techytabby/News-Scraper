Russian troops blocked evacuation attempts opened fire Ukraine's UN ambassador says Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN says Russia blocked “numerous attempts” to evacuate civilians from the suburbs of Kyiv Kharkiv Donetsk and Kherson. “They denied access of international organisations to provide humanitarian assistance to the most affected places” Sergiy Kyslytsya said during a meeting of the UNSC. “Russian troops opened fire on evacuees and evacuation vehicles shelled the roads allocated for humanitarian corridors.” He said Russia shelled roads near Mariupol and blew up a railway in Irpin in the Kyiv region adding that it would be “pure hypocrisy” to push Ukrainians to Belarus or to Russia while Europe’s borders are open to Ukrainian refugees.
