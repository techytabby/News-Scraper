Moscow updates troop death toll says 1351 killed Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll saying 1351 soldiers have been killed and 3825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine. The new toll announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2. At the time Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498. Kyiv says more than 16000 Russian troops have been killed while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7000-15000 personnel. ey Rue Ame cr Sr Ute lame] One month in
