Ukraine reports deaths from nuclear plant blaze Ukraine’s foreign ministry says that “several” people were killed and wounded in the now-extinguished fire that broke out as a result of Russia’s alleged attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant. The site’s employees are monitoring the plant to make sure it is operating safely and that radiation levels do not spike following the blaze the ministry which did not specify an exact death toll added in a statement on Facebook. But it warned there could be major radioactive damage if the facility's cooling process is disturbed. “Thousands of people — including civilians who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to ongoing shelling and fighting — would be hurt by this” the ministry said. It also called for Kyiv’s allies to take “urgent steps” to force Russian troops to withdraw from the area in order to ensure the facility’s safety. Moscow has blamed the attack at the site on Ukrainian saboteurs calling it a “monstrous provocation”.
