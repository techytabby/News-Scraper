EU to Russia: ‘War crimes must stop immediately’ European Union leaders have urged Russia to fully respect its obligations under international law and abide by the recent order by the International Court of Justice that told Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine. “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians” the leaders of the 27-nation EU said in a joint statement. “Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects including hospitals medical facilities schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately.”
