Mariupol evacuation halted for second time A second attempt to evacuate around 200000 civilians from a southern city under siege along designated humanitarian corridors has failed the International Committee of Red Cross has said. Evacuations from the port city of Mariupol were scheduled to begin at noon local time during a ceasefire according to Ukrainian military authorities. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said the planned evacuations were halted because of an ongoing assault. “There can be no ‘green corridors’ because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom“ he said on Telegram. Pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine’s National Guard accused each other of failing to establish a humanitarian corridor. The Interfax news agency cited an official of the Donetsk separatist administration who accused the Ukrainian forces of failing to observe the limited ceasefire. A first attempt at evacuating civilians from Mariupol and the nearby city of Volnovakha failed on Saturday.
