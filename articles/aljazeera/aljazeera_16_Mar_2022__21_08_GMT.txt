UN Security Council to vote Friday on Russian proposal The UN Security Council will vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops. The draft resolution also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia’s invasion of its neighbour the Reuters news agency reported. “Their resolution calls for parties to respect international humanitarian law but leaves out the fact that Russia is committing war crimes” said Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward.
