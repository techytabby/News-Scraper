UN: More than 350 civilians confirmed killed in Ukraine At least 351 civilians are confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine a UN monitoring mission said. Many of the civilian casualties were due to explosive weapons with a wide impact area including shelling from heavy artillery and multi- launch rocket systems and from missile and air raids monitors from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) revealed. “OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration” it said.
