‘Dozens of buses’ headed towards Mariupol amid third attempt to evacuate civilians Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reporting from near the city of Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine says there are “dozens of buses” heading towards Mariupol as part of efforts “to try and pull what ... could be hundreds of thousands of civilians out” from there. “They are being led by a police escort and there is at least one truck in that convoy which we understand is carrying humanitarian aid” Stratford said. “Now we know that this is at least the third time that a corridor has tried to be established to try and get people out not only of Mariupol but of other besieged cities in Ukraine [too].”
