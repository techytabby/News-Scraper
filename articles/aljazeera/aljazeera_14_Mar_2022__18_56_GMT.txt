Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv firing artillery on suburbs a local official said on Ukrainian television. The official also said a town councillor for Brovary east of Kyiv had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin Bucha and Hostomel which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan reporting from Kyiv said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person. “A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”
