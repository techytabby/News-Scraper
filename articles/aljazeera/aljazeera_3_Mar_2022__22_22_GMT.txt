IDPs recount spending ‘days and days’ without food Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people fleeing the conflict are being housed in public buildings in the outskirts of Dnipro. Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid reporting from a public school that is being used as a temporary shelter said many fleeing from Kharkiv and Mariupol as well as eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region had arrived at the facility. They will soon be continuing their journey to try and reach the nearest border. “There are a lot of people here ... a lot of children” Abdel-Hamid said. “Those who are fleeing Kharkiv told me how they spent days and days in the shelter with no food in the cold not being able at any point to go out” she added. Many said they “don’t know if they will ever return” Abdel-Hamid said.
