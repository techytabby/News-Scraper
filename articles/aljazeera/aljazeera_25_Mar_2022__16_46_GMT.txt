Biden suggests he wanted to visit Ukraine Biden has suggested that he wanted to visit Ukraine but was unable to because of the security situation there. “Tm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis and quite frankly part of my disappointment is that I can’t see it firsthand like I have in other places” Biden speaking alongside his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda said. “They will not let me — understandably I guess — cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine.” US President Joe Biden during a briefing on humanitarian efforts for Ukraine at Rzeszow- Jasionka Airport in Jasionka near Rzeszow Poland March 25 [Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]
