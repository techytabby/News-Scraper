US and UK rule out no-fly zone again The top diplomats from the UK and the United States have again ruled out establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine even a limited one to protect humanitarian corridors. “The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told reporters. “And that is not what we are looking at. What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-air defence systems.” Blinken echoed Truss’s remarks saying that Washington's aim is to end the war not expand it.
