Blinken accuses Russia of committing ‘war crimes’ US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine. “Yesterday President Biden said that — in his opinion — war crimes have been committed in Ukraine. Personally I agree” Blinken told reporters. “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.” Still Blinken said US State Department experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes to help international efforts towards accountability.
