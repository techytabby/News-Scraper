Expert says evidence so far raises ‘serious questions’ about Russian war crimes in Ukraine James Goldston executive director of the Open Society Foundation’s Justice Initiative says there seems to be ample evidence that at least raises “serious questions” of war crimes being committed in Ukraine. “We are seeing more and more reports of indiscriminate attacks ... attacks that are deliberately targeting civilians” Goldston told Al Jazeera from New York City. While the ICC is looking into the situation the challenge lies in linking “responsibility to those highest authorities... The question is whether they can make the case” Goldston said.
