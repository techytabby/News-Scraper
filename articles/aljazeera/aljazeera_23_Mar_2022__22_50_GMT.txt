Zelenskyy urges global protests against invasion Zelenskyy has called for global protests against the Russian invasion saying that Moscow is trying to defeat the freedom of “all the people in the world” and show that only crude force matters. “Task you to stand against the war starting from March 24 - exactly one month after the Russian invasion from this day and after then” Zelenskyy said in a video message in English. “Show your standing; come from your offices your homes your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine to sport freedom to support life.” Demonstrators rally for peace in front of the seat of the Swiss Bundeshaus in Bern [File: Armd Wiegmann/Reuters]
