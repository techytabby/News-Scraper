Pope calls Ukraine invasion ‘armed aggression’ Pope Francis has issued his toughest condemnation yet of the war in Ukraine saying the “unacceptable armed aggression” must stop. Speaking during his Sunday blessing to thousands of people in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City in Rome Francis also said the bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets was “barbaric” and with “no valid strategic reason”. “In the name of God I ask you: stop this massacre!” he said adding that Ukrainian cities risked “being reduced to cemeteries”.
