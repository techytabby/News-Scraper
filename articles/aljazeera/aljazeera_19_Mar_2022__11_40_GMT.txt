Turkey wants an end to Ukraine war: Presidential spokesman Turkey is to trying find a peaceful end to the conflict in Ukraine Ibrahim Kalin the Turkish presidential spokesman told Al Jazeera. “We are all trying to make it happen. Our president had two phone calls with President Zelenskyy and President Putin since the beginning of this war. We are all trying to get our different views and channels together to bring an end to this war. “President Putin thinks that his position at the moment on the key strategic issues of Donbas and Crimea are not close enough for him to meet President Zelenskyy. “The negotiation teams in Belarus are addressing technical issues. The very first political-level meeting took place in Antalya with the participation of our foreign minister. And now what we need is a strategic-level meeting between the two leaders. “As positions get closer on the four main issues of neutrality — that there is no NATO membership demilitarisation according to the Austrian model denazification which is kind of offensive of course to the Ukrainian leadership and then the protection of the Russian language. “Tf there is growing consensus and there seems to be then the last two strategic issues of the territorial and legal status of the Donbas and Crimea will be addressed.”
