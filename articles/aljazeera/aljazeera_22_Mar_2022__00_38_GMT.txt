Russia carried out 300 aircraft sorties over Ukraine in past 24 hours: US official A senior US defence official says the Russians have increased the number of military aircraft sorties over Ukraine over the past two days doing as many as 300 in the last 24 hours. But Russia still does not have air superiority over the country yet. The official said Ukraine has also increased the pace of its military flights but declined to provide numbers. The official said that most of the military flights involve air-to-ground strikes mainly on stationary targets and that the Russian aircraft are not spending a lot of time in Ukrainian airspace. The Ukraine military has continued to use its short and long-range air defence systems and drones to target Russian aircraft. The Russians have also increased naval activity in the northern Black Sea but there are no indications at this point of an amphibious assault on Odesa. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the military’s assessment.
