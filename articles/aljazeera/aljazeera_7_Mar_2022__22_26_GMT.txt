Czech president to award state honour to Ukraine's president Czech President Milos Zeman long sympathetic to Moscow says he will award the highest state honours to Zelenskyy for his bravery and courage in the face of Russia’s invasion. Zeman has been supportive of Ukraine saying the war was provoked by Russian aggression. He said a parliamentary deputy had proposed awarding Zelenskyy the highest Czech honours and he agreed. “[B]ecause the Ukrainian president has shown courage and bravery and although the United States offered him an evacuation he stayed in the capital of his country from where he is leading its defence.”
