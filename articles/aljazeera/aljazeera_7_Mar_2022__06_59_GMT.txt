UK may ease immigration rules for Ukrainian refugees The UK’s Home Secretary Priti Patel wants to set up a new scheme to allow more refugees fleeing conflict in Ukraine to enter the country according to a report by The Sun newspaper. The UK has already announced visa schemes for those who have family in the country or a willing sponsor but the government has been criticised by opposition lawmakers for not doing enough to help compared with its European neighbours. “Tm urgently escalating our response to the growing humanitarian crisis” Patel told The Sun citing her own experience visiting the Polish border last week. “I am now investigating the legal options to create a humanitarian route. This means anyone without ties to the UK fleeing the conflict in Ukraine will have a right to come to this nation.”
