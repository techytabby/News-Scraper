Russia's Lavrov not optimistic about talks Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the angry statements of Zelenskyy were not inspiring optimism about the fate of talks to end hostilities in Ukraine. Earlier Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was open to talks with Lavrov but only if such negotiations were “meaningful”. Lavrov also said that Russia was checking information that Ukrainian authorities may not be allowing civilians to be evacuated from the city of Mariupol via humanitarian corridors agreed earlier.
