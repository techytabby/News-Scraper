Second Abramovich superyacht docks in Turkey A second superyacht linked to Roman Abramovich has docked in the Turkish resort of Marmaris after Western governments slammed sanctions on the Russian billionaire. On Monday another yacht reached Bodrum after skirting the waters of European Union countries.  While strongly criticising the invasion Turkey said it is against sanctions imposed by its NATO allies on principle making Ankara a safe haven for Russians seeking to make investments and preserve assets.
