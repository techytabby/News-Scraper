Chelsea sale on hold due to sanctions on owner Abramovich European football champions Chelsea are now effectively controlled by the British government after sanctions were imposed against Russian owner Roman Abramovich. Abramovich had announced he was selling the Premier League club last week. That process is now on hold leaving the west London club ranked by Forbes as the seventh-most valuable in world football at $3.2bn operating under a special government licence. Chelsea was holding an emergency meeting to discuss the future of the club. The sale of match tickets has been put on hold but ticket holders will be allowed to attend matches. The club will not be allowed to buy or sell players while the sanctions are in place but can pay the wages of players and coaching staff.
