Zelenskyy urges Russian servicemen to surrender Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Russian servicemen to surrender in order to be treated “with dignity”. “You won't take anything from Ukraine. You will be taking lives there are many of you. But your lives will be taken too. Why should you die and what for?” Zelenskyy said in Russian as part of his televised address to Ukrainians. “On behalf of the Ukrainian people we are giving you a chance. A chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces we will treat you the way people should be treated. People — with dignity the way you have not been treated in your army and the way your army does not treat ours” he said.
