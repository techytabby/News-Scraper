US grants temporary protection to Ukrainians in the country Biden’s administration has said it is shielding Ukrainian citizens already in the country from deportation. The US Department of Homeland Security said it is offering temporary protected status (TPS) to Ukrainians for 18 months because the current situation prevents them from safely returning to the country. “Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war senseless violence and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said.
