Ukraine first lady condemns ‘mass murder’ of civilians Olena Zelenska the Ukrainian president’s wife has thanked Kyiv’s allies for their support and urged them to do more to deter Russia. Zelenska also said in an open letter that the Russian invasion of Ukraine amounted to “the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians”. “The most terrifying and devastating of this invasion are the child casualties” she said mentioning eight-year-old Alice who died on the streets of Okhtyrka while her grandfather tried to protect her and Polina a child from Kyiv who died in shelling alongside her parents. She also cited 14-year-old Arseniy who was hit in the head by wreckage and could not be saved because an ambulance could not get to him on time because of intense fires.
