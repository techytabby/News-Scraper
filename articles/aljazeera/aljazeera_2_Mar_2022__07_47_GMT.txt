Russia aims to ‘erase us’ Ukraine's Zelenskyy says Zelenskyy has claimed that nearly 6000 Russians have been killed during Moscow's invasion and warned the Kremlin it will not be able to take control of Ukraine with bombs and air raids. In a video address the Ukrainian president said a Russian missile strike in the capital on Tuesday which hit a Holocaust memorial complex “proves that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is absolutely foreign”. “They don’t know a thing about Kyiv about our history. But they all have orders to erase our history erase our country erase us all” he added. Russia has not publically declared how many of its troops have been killed and Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided by Zelenskky.
