Czechs will look after Ukraine's ‘wives and children’: PM Prime Minister Petr Fiala says his country would take care of the “wives and children” fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has driven about 3 million Ukrainians to seek refuge in the EU’s eastern flank. Fiala who travelled to Kyiv earlier this week with his Polish and Slovenian counterparts to meet Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy added that the Czech Republic could cope with further refugee arrivals from Ukraine.
