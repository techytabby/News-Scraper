Proposals of humanitarian corridors to Russia are ‘absurd’ US says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has dismissed Moscow’s proposals for opening humanitarian corridors to allow Ukrainian civilians to flee to Russia as “absurd”. “The Kremlin’s proposals to create humanitarian corridors leading into Russia and Belarus are absurd” Blinken said in a press conference with his UK counterpart Liz Truss. “It’s offensive to suggest the Ukrainian people should seek refuge from the very government that has demonstrated such disregard for their lives.”
