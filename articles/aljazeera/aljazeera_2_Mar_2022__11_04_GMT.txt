UAE reimposes visa requirements on Ukrainians The Ukrainian embassy in the United Arab Emirates says the Gulf country is reimposing visa requirements on Ukrainians. The embassy posted on its Facebook page that the measure which means any Ukrainian passport holders wanting to visit the UAE will now need a visa first had taken effect from Tuesday. The energy-rich UAE which relies on Russian and Ukrainian wheat exports is home to some 15000 Ukrainian residents among its roughly eight million foreign residents and one million Emirati citizens. Like other Gulf Arab states it does not recognise individuals fleeing war and has not permitted refugees from Syria Iraq and other wars to seek asylum or seek resettlement. Last week it abstained during a UN Security Council vote condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
