Ukrainian official accuses Russia of largely failing to respect evacuation plans An adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry has accused Russian forces of largely failing to respect agreements to allow civilians to be evacuated from towns and cities through humanitarian corridors. Evacuations took place from the cities of Sumy and Enerhodar but not from Kharkiv and only partially in areas in the Kyiv region Vadym Denysenko said in televised remarks. Kyiv had earlier said it would attempt to evacuate civilians through six humanitarian corridors on Wednesday — from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia; Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia; Sumy to Poltava; Izyum to Lozova; Volnovakha to Pokrovske; and from several towns around Kyiv including Vorzel Borodyanka Bucha Irpin and Hostomel to the capital. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement that Ukrainian armed forces had agreed to stop firing in those areas from gam until 9pm local time (07:00-19:00 GMT) and urged Russian forces to fulfil their commitment to local ceasefires. ussia-Ukraine war: Evacuation of Sumy civilians continues UKRAINE evacuations
