Pope Francis: Ukraine conflict ‘not a military operation but a war’ Pope Francis has rejected Russia's assertion that it is carrying out “a special military operation” in Ukraine saying the country was being battered by war. “In Ukraine rivers of blood and tears are flowing. This is not only a military operation but a war which is leading to death destruction and misery” the pope said in his weekly address to crowds gathered in St Peter’s Square in the Vatican City.
