‘Credible reports’ of Russia using cluster munitions: UN The UN’s human rights office says it has received “credible reports” of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine adding that indiscriminate use of such weapons might amount to war crimes. “Due to their wide area effects the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities” OHCHR spokeswoman Liz Throssell told reporters at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. “We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.” Ukraine: The information war | The Listening Post lad ero Bs! ag ios a rytiiayy — 4 UKRAINE wad
