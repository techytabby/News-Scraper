US Congress edges closer to authori for Ukraine ing aid The US Congress appears to be on the cusp of an agreement that would allocate billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine among other things. Sweeping legislation awaiting final approval from Democratic and Republican congressional leaders was expected to provide as much as $14bn to help Ukraine respond to Russia’s invasion. “Republicans and Democrats are very very close to finalising the agreement. I expect there will be text released in a few hours” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at a mid-afternoon news conference.
