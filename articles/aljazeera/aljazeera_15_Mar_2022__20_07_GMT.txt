War in Ukraine takes centre stage at Hungary's election rallies The war in Ukraine has taken centre stage in Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s election campaign as the populist leader attempts to win a fourth consecutive term. “It is in our interests to not be a sacrificial pawn in someone else’s war. We can't win anything in this war but we have everything to lose” Orban said. Hungary has sought to balance its fraught relationship with its allies in the European Union and the NATO military alliance with its close ties to Russia. Orban has agreed to back the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU and condemned Moscow's violent assault on Ukraine.
