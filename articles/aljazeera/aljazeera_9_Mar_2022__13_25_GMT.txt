EU adds 160 Russian oligarchs lawmakers to sanctions blacklist The EU is stepping up its sanctions response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine targeting more Russian lawmakers and oligarchs as well as banks in Moscow’s ally Belarus. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the 27- nation bloc was blacklisting 160 more individuals banning exports of maritime navigation technology to Russia and including crypto assets under its punitive measures. “We are further tightening the net of sanctions responding to Russia's military aggression against Ukraine” she tweeted. The names of the 160 individuals — which include 146 members of Russia's upper house of parliament and 14 Kremlin-linked oligarchs and their relatives — will be unveiled shortly when the new sanctions are formally published in the EU’s official journal.
