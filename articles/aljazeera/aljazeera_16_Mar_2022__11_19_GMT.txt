Portugal alters law that allowed Abramovich to get citizenship Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva says legislation that enabled Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to get Portuguese citizenship due to his alleged ascendancy from Sephardic Jews has been changed — but the changes will not be retroactive. “The decree introduces a requirement for [applicants to have an] effective connection with Portugal” the minister said describing it as a “mechanism” to prevent the law to be “manipulated.”
