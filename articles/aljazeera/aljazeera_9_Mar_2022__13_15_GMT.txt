Dutch PM says ‘not possible’ for EU to cut off Russian energy supplies immediately Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said it is not possible for the EU to immediately cut off Russian supplies of oil and gas to the bloc. “We have to discuss our vulnerabilities in terms of our dependency on Russian oil and Russian gas. I would not plead for cutting off our supply of oil and gas from Russia today; it’s not possible because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth” Rutte said during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. “But we can do more to get the green agenda going to decarbonise our economies” he added.
