Ukraine says Moscow forcibly taking civilians to Russia Ukraine says Moscow has forcibly taken 402000 civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up. Lyudmyla Denisova Ukraine’s ombudsperson said the figure included 84000 children. She said they were being held in primitive conditions with little food and water. The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they wanted to go to Russia. Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian- speaking and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.
