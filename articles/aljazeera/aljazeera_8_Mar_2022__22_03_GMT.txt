It's ‘clear’ Russia will lose conflict says US official Nuland who is speaking at a congressional hearing says Russia is destined to lose its war in Ukraine. “It is clear that Russia will lose this conflict — whether they lose it quickly or whether they lose it extremely slowly it is only a matter of time” said the State Department under secretary. “The problem is that if this can be lost quickly many many many lives will be saved which is why we have to continue to pour on the economic pressure; we have to continue to support the defensive needs of the Ukrainian people.”
