EU Commission proposes temporary residence rights for Ukrainian refugees The EU’s executive arm the European Commission has proposed that the bloc grant temporary residence rights to people fleeing Ukraine. Designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons inside the EU the new legislation will provide the same level of protection to Ukrainians in all 27 of the bloc’s member states and allow them to obtain residence permits as well as access to employment and social welfare. The proposal will be discussed by EU interior ministers on Thursday.
