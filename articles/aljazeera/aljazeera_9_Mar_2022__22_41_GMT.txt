IMF approves $1.4bn emergency funding for Ukraine The International Monetary Fund has said its executive board approved $1.4bn in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic effect of Russia’s military invasion. “The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said predicting a deep recession in Ukraine this year. “Financing needs are large urgent and could rise significantly as the war continues” she said. Once the war was over Ukraine was likely to need additional “large support”. The global lender said Ukrainian authorities had cancelled an existing stand-by lending arrangement with the IMF but would work with the fund to design an appropriate economic programme focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permit.
