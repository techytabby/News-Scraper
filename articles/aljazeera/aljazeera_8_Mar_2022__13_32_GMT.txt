How are the evacuations going? Ukrainian officials say civilians have been evacuated from Irpin and Sumy after Russia declared a ceasefire and opened “humanitarian corridors”. The route out of Irpin a town on the outskirts of Kyiv leads to the capital. Meanwhile those fleeing Sumy are heading south to the city of Poltava. But it is unclear if anyone has been able to leave Mariupol. Kyiv says Russian forces have shelled the corridor leading out of the city to Zaporizhzhia. Moscow also said it had opened corridors for evacuations from Kyiv Chenihiv and Kharkiv. It was not clear whether mass evacuations were taking place from those locations.
