Why Security Council will not vote on Russia's ‘humanitarian’ draft resolution Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey reporting from the UN said Ukraine’s ambassador delivered “an impassioned response” at the Security Council to Russia’s denial that it is the aggressor in the conflict. Russia had put forward a humanitarian resolution that was expected to come up for a vote on Friday Saloomey explained but Moscow said it would no longer bring that measure to a vote. “Tt was clear the US was not going to back that without wording in that resolution acknowledging that the reason for the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there is the Russians’ aggression” she said. Friday’s meeting will still take place she said but the focus will be on Russia’s allegation of US-backed biological laboratories in Ukraine — a claim the US Ukraine and other allies have rejected.
