Ukraine's Zelenskyy calls for action against ‘nuclear terrorism’ Zelenskyy has reiterated remarks made earlier by the country’s United Nations envoy who accused Moscow of “nuclear terrorism” after a fire broke out at a training facility near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “Nuclear terrorism requires decisive action in response” Zelenskyy said in a Twitter post. He added: “At the #UN Security Council meeting we called for closing the sky over va and launching an operation to maintain peace and security. The goal is to save hazardous facilities. The world must not watch but help!”
