China in ‘tough spot’ amid Russia's reported request for aid: Analyst Brett Bruen a former Obama administration official says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses both risks and opportunities for China. “China is in a tough spot at the moment because on the one hand they see an opportunity with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to weaken the West and try to reorder the international order. But at the same time there’s a whole number of risks ... both economic and security” he told Al Jazeera. “The fact that this invasion has not gone according to plan is certainly concerning for Beijing and that is going to weigh heavily on their next move. “China was fine to go along if this was going to be a quick and relatively easy invasion. The more complicated it gets the more it complicates China’s position. What the Americans are doing right now is to publicly put that pressure on Beijing to force them into making a decision. And I think the near unanimity in the international community on this makes it even more challenging for Beijing to be an outlier.” Tr Coes aTTate Matsui sts) yo) MOOT Lea SIO RS lad INSIDE STORY 4 UKRAINE WAR... © China role
