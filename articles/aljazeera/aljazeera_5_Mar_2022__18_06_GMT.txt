Russia resumes ‘offensive’ after Mariupol ceasefire: Ministry Russia’s defence ministry says it has resumed “offensive actions” in Ukraine after announcing a ceasefire earlier in the day to allow residents of two besieged cities to evacuate. “Due to the unwillingness of the Ukrainian side to influence nationalists or extend the ceasefire offensive actions have been resumed at 18:00 Moscow time [15:00 GMT]” Defence Ministry Spokesperson Igor Konashenkoyv said in a video briefing. Earlier city officials in Mariupol said in a statement on social media that since the Russian side did not adhere to the ceasefire “the evacuation of the civilian population has been postponed”.
