Aid group concerned about potential child trafficking in Ukraine Peter Walsh country director of Save the Children in Ukraine has said the organisation is concerned about the potential of human trafficking and child trafficking in the country amid the Russian invasion. “One of our main focuses both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries is to identify unaccompanied and separated children” Walsh told Al Jazeera from the western city of Lviv. “We must have some international agreements between the neighbouring countries and Ukraine to ensure safeguarding measures are put in place to protect children and prevent them from being trafficked.”
