China rejects US accusation it is not acting in line with UN charter The Chinese foreign ministry says it firmly rejects US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s comment that China’s unwillingness to condemn Russia is inconsistent with China's position on the United Nations charter. China always believes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states should be upheld said Zhao Lijian spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry at a regular press conference. In an interview with NPR news on Wednesday Blinken said the fact that China “has not stood strongly against” Russia's aggression in Ukraine flies in the face of China’s commitments as a permanent member of the UN Security Council responsible for maintaining peace and security. “It’s totally inconsistent with what China says and repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the United Nations charter and the basic principles including the sovereignty of nations” Blinken said. : Di Reto Mule AURORE RAC Rem: Ol crip <8 8 Na Ty UKRAINE WAR Human costs mount in the 3rd week
