More than 700 civilians killed so far in Ukraine UN says More than 700 civilians — including 52 children — have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded but the “actual number is likely much higher” UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council. “Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed as have hospitals and schools” DiCarlo said. She added that the UN human rights agency has recorded 726 deaths as well as 1174 people injured including 63 children between February 24 and March 15. DiCarlo did not specify who was to blame. “This demands a thorough investigation and accountability” she said.
