Former Russian foreign minister condemns Kremlin's diplomats A former Russian foreign minister who served under Boris Yeltsin has condemned the Kremlin’s diplomats calling their conduct during the country’s invasion of Ukraine “disgusting”. Speaking to United Kingdom broadcaster Sky Andrei Kozyrev said that Russian diplomats should resign accusing them of having “disgraced themselves” by defending the invasion. “They just spread the propaganda and it’s not for decent diplomats to spread propaganda” he said. “They've disgraced themselves and listening to them or kind of negotiating with them under the circumstances is just a waste of time and waste of your own self-respect” Kozyrev added.
