‘No threat to Sumy’ from ammonia leak: Official Zhyvytskyy says “there is no threat” to the city of Sumy from an ammonia leak at a nearby chemical plant because the wind is blowing away from the city. He added that the leak at the Sumykhimprom plant is contaminating an area with a radius of 2.5km (1.5 miles) and not 5km (3 miles) as previously thought. He did not say what caused the leak. The Sumykhimprom plant is on the eastern outskirts of the city which has a population of about 263000 and has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks.
