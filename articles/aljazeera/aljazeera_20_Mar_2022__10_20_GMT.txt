‘Deteriorating situation in Mariupol’: Al Jazeera correspondent The besieged port city of Mariupol is witnessing worsening conditions Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said after the city council said an art school sheltering 400 people was bombed by Russia. “We are still waiting to see whether there are survivors” McBride said speaking from the western city of Lviv. “The problem the authorities in Mariupol say is that they simply can’t get close to this place because of the ongoing fierce fighting in the surrounding street.” While people are being allowed to leave through humanitarian corridors the Russian soldiers are checking if they are civilians instead of being soldiers or fighters he added.
