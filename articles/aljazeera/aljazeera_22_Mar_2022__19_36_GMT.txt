US condemns Navalny conviction as attempt to silence opposition in Russia The United States has condemned a Russian court verdict that found jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny guilty of additional charges saying it was an attempt to silence him and distract him from the invasion of Ukraine. “The court’s sham ruling is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny” State Department spokesman Ned Price said. “This disturbing decision... is another example of the Russian government’s widening crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression which is intended to hide the Kremlin's brutal war and unprovoked war against Ukraine.”
