Lavrov says Russia will not let Ukraine obtain nuclear weapons: Report Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said Moscow will not allow Ukraine to obtain nuclear weapons according to a report by the country’s TASS news agency. Lavrov’s reported remarks came a day after he alleged at a Geneva disarmament meeting that Kyiv has been seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. “Ukraine still has Soviet technologies and the means of delivery of such weapons” he told the Conference on Disarmament in a pre- recorded address. “We cannot fail to respond to this real danger.” Lavrov delivered his speech to a thin crowd after diplomats from many countries staged a walk-out to protest against Russia’s invasion. Moscow has moved to put its own nuclear forces on high alert in recent days. NUCLEAR WEAPONS Nuclear warheads per country Nine countries possessed roughly 12700 warheads as of early 2022.
