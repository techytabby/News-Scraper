Australian missiles ‘on the ground’ in Ukraine: Morrison After Australia last week promised Ukraine $50m in missiles ammunition and other military hardware to fight Russian invaders Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday said: “Our missiles are on the ground now.” He also described Russia and China’s closer relationship as opportunistic rather than strategic labelling the alliance as an “are of autocracy”. He said Russia and China would prefer a new world order to the one that has been in place since World War II. Morrison criticised Beijing’s failure to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s expansion of trade in Russian wheat while other countries are imposing sanctions.
