Zelenskyy calls hospital bombing ‘war crime’ Ukraine’s Zelenskyy has described the attack on a children’s hospital in the southeastern city of Mariupol as a “war crime” after it prompted international condemnation. “We have not done and would never do anything like this war crime in any of the cities of the Donetsk or Luhansk regions or of any region ... because we are people. But are you?” Zelenskyy said switching to Russian to make his point. “What kind of a country is Russia that it is afraid of hospitals and maternity wards and destroys them?” he said. “The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place.” Zelenskyy also reiterated his call for Western powers to enforce a no- fly zone over Ukraine to prevent more attacks. “Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves” he said.
