Dozens feared dead in Mykolaiv barracks attack Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said a Russian air raid on Friday that hit an army barrack housing about 200 soldiers in the southern city of Mykolaiv may have killed dozens according to reports by witnesses. “We hear reports that the number [of deaths] is as high as 100 as rescue efforts are under way” Basravi said reporting from Lviv in western Ukraine. “The state of the remains of so many people who were at the barracks at the time are such that is making it difficult to have an accurate account of exactly how many people were killed or injured in that strike” Basravi said. “That gives you an idea on how grim the situation on the ground is.”
