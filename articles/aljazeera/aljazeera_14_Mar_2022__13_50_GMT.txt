More than 160 cars exit Mariupol via evacuation corridor More than 160 civilian cars have been able to drive out of the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route the city authorities have said. “As of 13:00 pm (1100 GMT) more than 160 private cars have managed to leave Mariupol on the road to Berdyansk” the city council said on Telegram in a significant evacuation since Russian forces surrounded the city early this month. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had warned on Sunday that residents faced a “worst-case scenario” unless the warring parties reached an agreement to ensure their immediate safety and access to humanitarian aid.
