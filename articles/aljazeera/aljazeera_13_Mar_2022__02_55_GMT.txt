Zelenskyy warns against ‘pseudo- republics’ Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics” in Ukraine to break his country apart President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said in his nightly address to the nation. Zelenskyy has called on Ukraine’s regions including Kherson which was captured by Russian forces not to repeat the experience of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pro-Russian separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in those eastern regions in 2014. “The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics” Zelenskyy said. “They are blackmailing local leaders putting pressure on deputies looking for someone to bribe.” City council members in Kherson a southern city of 290000 on Saturday rejected plans for a new pseudo-republic Zelenskyy said. “Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land” he said.
