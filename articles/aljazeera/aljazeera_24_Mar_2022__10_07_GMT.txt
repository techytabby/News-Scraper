Kremlin says Abramovich played early role in Russia-Ukraine talks The Kremlin’s spokesman has said that sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich played an early role in talks between Russia and Ukraine but the process was now in the hands of the two sides’ negotiating teams. “He did take part at the initial stage” Peskov told reporters. “Now the negotiations are between the two teams the Russians and Ukrainians.” Western governments have targeted Abramovich and several other Russian oligarchs with sanctions as they seek to isolate Putin and his allies.
