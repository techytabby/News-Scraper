WFP says ‘it's going to be hell on earth’ if food production in Ukraine fails to resume World Food Program director has told Al Jazeera that ending the war in Ukraine is key to avoiding a global food supply shortage which would have catastrophic repercussions around the world. “If we don’t act now strategically and quickly it’s going to be hell on earth” David Beasley said in Brussels. Beasley added that before the Russian invasion the UN agency was already cutting 8 million people to 50 percent rations in Yemen Niger Chad and other countries due to rising costs. “Now we'll have a supply issue because Ukraine and Russia produce between 20 and 30 percent of all the grain in the world” he said.
