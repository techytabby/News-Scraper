Zelenskyy says defence lines holding against Russian attacks Ukraine’s defence lines are holding amid Russia’s multipronged assault the country’s president says. In his latest video address Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of his country since midnight. But he pointed to Russia's alleged shelling of civilian areas in several key cities as proof Ukraine had been successful in resisting the Kremlin’s initial plan of claiming a quick victory through a land assault. “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom” Zelenskyy said adding Ukraine was receiving daily arms supplies from its international allies.
