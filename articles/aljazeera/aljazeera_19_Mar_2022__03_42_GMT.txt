China's ‘neutral line’ designed to secure peaceful resolution: Analyst Al Jazeera has talked to Beijing-based analyst Andy Mok about the call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. Mok who is a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization says China has been consistent in its stance on the conflict and that maintaining a neutral line was the most effective way to reach a peaceful resolution. “Let’s not conflate condemning with abstaining. These are two very different things” he said. “If we look at even the other countries around the world: UAE Saudi Arabia even Mexico have not joined the US in condemning Russia so I think the US actually runs the risk of being isolated [on Ukraine]. This is the real story; that not as many countries are with the US as reported in the Western media.” At the UN General Assembly earlier this month 141 countries backed a resolution calling on Russia to stop its offensive against Ukraine with small states and world powers alike condemning the invasion.
