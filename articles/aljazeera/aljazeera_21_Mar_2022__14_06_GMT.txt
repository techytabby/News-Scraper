At least 925 civilians killed in Ukraine UN says The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) says it has confirmed at least 925 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion on February 24 but warned the true toll is likely to be “considerably higher”. Another 1496 civilians have been injured as of midnight on Sunday amid Russia's onslaught according to OHCHR’s figures. “Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems and missile and air strikes” the organisation said in a statement. “OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration” it added citing several areas including Mariupol.
