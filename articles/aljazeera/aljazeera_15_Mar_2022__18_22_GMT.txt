Ukraine tells IAEA Russia preventing it from answering Chernobyl questions The Ukrainian nuclear regulator has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it is unable to provide information on radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl due to Russian control of the site. “The regulator said for the first time today that information it received regarding Chornobyl was ‘controlled by the Russian military forces’ and therefore it could not ‘always provide detailed answers to all’ of the IAEA’s questions” the IAEA said in a statement adding that was also the case at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
