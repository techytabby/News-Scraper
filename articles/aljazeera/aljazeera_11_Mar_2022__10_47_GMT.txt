Kremlin warns Meta will have to cease work in Russia if Reuters report is true Moscow will end the activities of Meta Platforms in Russia if a report that it will allow users of its social media sites in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers proves true the Kremlin’s spokesman has said. Citing leaked internal emails Reuters reported on Thursday that Meta will allow Facebook and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion signalling a temporary change to its hate speech policy. “We don’t want to believe the Reuters report — it is just too difficult to believe” Peskov told reporters. “We hope it is not true because if it is true then it will mean that there will have to be the most decisive measures to end the activities of this company” he added.
