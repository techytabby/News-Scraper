US assesses up to 60% failure rate for some Russian missiles: Report Three US officials have told the Reuters news agency that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 percent for some of the precision- guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine. Reuters said the US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high missile failure rates. If true the agency said it could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures. UKRAINE ~ devastation —
