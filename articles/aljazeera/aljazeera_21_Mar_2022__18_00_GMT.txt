EU agrees to 5000-strong response force in defence push The European Union has approved a new defence strategy designed to increase the bloc’s capacity to act including setting up a 5000-strong rapid reaction force. “It’s not the answer to the Ukrainian war but it is part of the answer” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at a meeting of the bloc’s foreign and defence ministers. The plan had been in the pipeline for two years but underwent a last- minute rewrite to increase the focus on the threat from Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine. “When we started working we couldn't imagine that at the last moment of approval the situation would be so bad and Europe would be facing such a big challenge” Borrell added.
