Russia increasingly relying on ‘missiles rockets and artillery’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan reporting from Kyiv says several neighbourhoods within the Ukrainian capital have come under attack in the past 24 hours. Moscow is increasingly relying on attacks with “missiles rockets and artillery” because of its “ground offensive being stalled” he said. “They want to put pressure not just on the front lines but on the city [of Kyiv] itself” Khan added.
