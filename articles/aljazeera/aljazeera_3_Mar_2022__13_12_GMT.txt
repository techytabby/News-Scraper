Ukrainian Russian officials trade barbs at UN Human Rights Council meeting Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister has accused Russian troops of carrying out acts tantamount to war crimes in her country and called for perpetrators to be held accountable. “Recent events clearly point to the fact that the Russian troops fighting in Ukraine carry out the most blatant violations and abuses of human rights systematically engage in acts that clearly amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity” Emine Dzhaparova told an urgent debate at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. “We must stand together to ensure accountability for the war criminals spilling the blood of Ukrainian children.” Gennady Gatilov Russia’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva later said Moscow saw no “added value” in the debate and denounced Ukraine’s government as a “criminal regime”. |kraine war: Hospital struggling to prepare for Russian ar_s ad e Cate ead
