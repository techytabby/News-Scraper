Ukrainian official sees no big change at front-line hotspots Ukraine’s armed forces are conducting small-scale counterattacks on several fronts and Russian troops have not been able to gain ground because of a lack of resources according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. “The situation ... in the main hotspots has not changed and has no chance of changing as Russia has used up its resources” he told a video briefing. Arestovych said Russia continued to fire missiles at Ukrainian targets with approximately two-thirds of rockets hitting civilian buildings and infrastructure. Al Jazeera has been unable to immediately verify this information. Russia has denied targeting civilians.
