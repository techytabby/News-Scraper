Russia North Korea discuss developing relations Russia’s foreign ministry says the country’s deputy foreign minister has met North Korea’s ambassador to Russia to discuss developing bilateral relations “in the context of changes happening on the international arena”. Igor Morgulov talks with Sin Hong-chol come as Moscow faces increasing isolation over its invasion of Ukraine. North Korea last month blamed the Ukraine crisis on the “hegemonic policy” and “high-handedness” of the US and the West.
