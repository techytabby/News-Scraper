‘Destruction and misery’ in central Kharkiv Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford has entered Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine where he witnessed “scenes of utter devastation” in the centre of the city following shelling by Russian forces. “I am absolutely shocked by what we have seen ... this is what the power of Russian bombing can do to civilian areas” Stratford said from the scene where an enormous Russian shell exploded several days ago. He described the immediate area as “completely devastated” noting there were buildings still on fire and that a nearby church had been badly damaged with all of its windows blown out. “The people here cannot in any way wrap their heads around how the leader of a civilised country like Russia could do this to a city like Kharkiv” Stratford said. “Some of the people we spoke to are literally walking around in a daze unable to comprehend what has just happened to them ... and their beloved city. “And now look at it. It has. It is an absolutely shocking scene of destruction and misery.” Al Jazeera English @ vw @AJEnglish Replying to @AJEnglish and @natachabut An Al Jazeera team was able to enter the devastated city of Kharkiv in Ukraine after Russia announced a pause in fighting to allow people to leave.
