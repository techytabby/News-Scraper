Pope leads global prayer for peace between Russia and Ukraine Pope Francis has led the world’s Catholic bishops in praying for peace between Russia and Ukraine saying the world had forgotten the tragedies of the 20th century and was still menaced by nuclear war. Francis presided at a service in St Peter’s Basilica where he prayed for the protection of all humanity “especially Russia and Ukraine”. Ina separate homily before reciting the prayer Francis spoke of “scenes of death” in which “bombs are destroying the homes of many of our defenceless Ukrainian brothers and sisters” and of “a cruel and senseless war that threatens our world”. The pope posted several messages in English Russian and Ukrainian on Twitter on Friday stressing peace and forgiveness.
