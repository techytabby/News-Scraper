Russian space agency asks for end to sanctions Russia's space agency has sent NASA and other international partners a letter demanding an end to sanctions saying they could threaten the International Space Station (ISS). The head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin said on Twitter the letter appealed to the space agencies of the US Canada and Europe to keep the space station operational. He illustrated the appeal with a map showing the flight path of the ISS — and a potential fall zone that straddles much of the world but barely touches upon Russia.
