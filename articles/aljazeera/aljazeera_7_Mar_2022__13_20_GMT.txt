Russia will stop offensive ‘ina moment’ if Ukraine meets demands Kremlin says Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt its offensive “in a moment” if Kyiv meets a list of conditions Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Peskov told the Reuters news agency that Moscow was demanding that Ukraine cease military action and change its constitution to enshrine neutrality. The Kremlin also wants Kyiv to acknowledge the annexed Crimean Peninsula as Russian territory and recognise the self-proclaimed separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhuansk in Ukraine’s east as independent states he added. Peskov told Reuters all the demands had been formulated and announced during the first two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations which took place last week.
