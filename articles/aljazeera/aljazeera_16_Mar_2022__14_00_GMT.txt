Council of Europe expels Russia from human rights body The Council of Europe has expelled Russia from the continent’s foremost human rights body in an unprecedented move over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation committee of ministers said in statement that “the Russian Federation ceases to be a member of the Council of Europe as from today after 26 years of membership.” Early in the week the group’s parliamentary assembly already initiated the process of expulsion and unanimously backed that Russia would be kicked out. Russia has announced it was pulling out of the council which means it will no longer be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and its citizens will no longer be able to file applications to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
