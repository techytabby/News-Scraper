NATO chief says humanitarian corridors a ‘bare minimum’ need NATO’s secretary-general has said establishing humanitarian corridors in Ukraine is the “bare minimum” that must be done now as Russia's offensive intensifies. “I continue to believe it is important that we work hard for a political diplomatic solution” Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters on the sidelines of the diplomacy forum in Antalya Turkey a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba held talks in the city. “[But] the bare minimum is to establish humanitarian corridors where people can get out and humanitarian aid can get in” he added. Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO will not send troops or jets into Ukraine amid fears such a move could lead to a full-fledged war between the alliance’s 30-member states and Russia.
