‘War is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine's borders; says UK envoy British Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward has called on Russia to end the war saying that the conflict is causing suffering worldwide not just in Ukraine. “President Putin’s war is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine's borders” Woodward told the UN Security Council. “Thousands of students — many from nations around this table — have been caught up in the violence. The war is spiking food and energy prices bringing further pain to countries in the developing world already suffering from the impact of COVID and famine and conflict and climate. Millions of refugees have been taken in by countries across Europe.” -_—_. OSES UK's Woodward (eft) says the war's effects are being felt across the world [David ‘Dee’ Delgado/Reuters]
