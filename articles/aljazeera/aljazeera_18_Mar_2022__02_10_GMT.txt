‘We are different now’: Zelenskyy tells Russia Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is different from the one Russia found in 2014 when it seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region. “The occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before in 2014-2015 which they corrupted and were not afraid of. But we are different now” he said. “And it allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale attack for 22 days.”
