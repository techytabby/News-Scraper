Russia drops peace talks with Japan over Ukraine Russia has announced it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal World War II peace treaty due to Tokyo’s response to Moscow’s military action in Ukraine. “The Russian side in the current conditions does not intend to continue talks with Japan on the peace treaty due to the impossibility of discussing the core document on bilateral relations with a country that has taken an openly hostile position and is striving to cause harm to the interests of our country” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. Tokyo last week announced plans to revoke Russia’s most-favoured- nation trade status expand the scope of asset freezes against Russian elites and ban imports of certain products over its incursion in Ukraine. Russia and Japan have still not formally ended World War II hostilities because of a standoff over the islands known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories.
