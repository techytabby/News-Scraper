UK to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia impose new import tariffs The UK has said it would ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and impose new tariffs on 900 million pounds ($1.2bn) worth of Russian imports including vodka. “Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect” Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.
