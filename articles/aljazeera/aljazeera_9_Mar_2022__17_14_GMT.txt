‘We must double down on our sanctions; says UK's Truss UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for further sanctions against Russia urging more countries to join in the effort to isolate Moscow economically. “We must double down on our sanctions. That includes a full SWIFT [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication] ban and the G7 ending its use of Russian oil and gas” Truss said. “The United States and the United Kingdom this week announced our plans to stop importing Russian oil and the EU have announced their plans to reduce their dependency too. We want to encourage a wider group of countries to get on board with our sanctions effort.”
