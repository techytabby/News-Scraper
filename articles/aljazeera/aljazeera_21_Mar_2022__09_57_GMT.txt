EU warns of ‘huge risk’ of child trafficking as Ukrainians flee The EU’s home affairs commissioner has warned that vulnerable Ukrainian children are in “huge” danger of being trafficked as they flee from Russia's offensive. Ylva Johansson told a news conference in Estonia that about half of the 3.3 million Ukrainians who had fled to EU countries since the start of the war were children. Ukraine has a high number of orphans and children born through surrogate mothers who had not been picked up by their parents. That increased the risk that they could be abducted or become victims of forced adoptions Johansson said. “There is a huge risk of vulnerable children being trafficked” she added noting there had already been reports of such instances. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR Where are people fleeing to? The United Nations says more than 33 million people mostly women and children have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded. Most have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.   Day 26 | 04:30 GMT eee t=} MOL 2 ery CRIMEA sevastop % Black Seq ba @atabs OI
