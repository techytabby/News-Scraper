Aid chief calls for immediate ceasefire The secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine saying aid workers cannot “save lives under a hail of bombs and grenades”. “We cannot come to the relief of vulnerable communities engulfed by war when our aid workers are in bomb shelters and fleeing from attacks” Jan Egeland said in a statement. “Millions are now in front-line locations. With empty shops overwhelmed healthcare and no electricity or safe water local and international aid groups on the ground must urgently resume our work” he added before warning of “mounting numbers of civilian casualties across the country”. “The madness must stop. The men who started this war sit in safe and comfortable offices. They can end it today and resume meaningful political talks. Defenceless civilians are paying the highest price for their senseless war.” NRC@ v @NRC_Norway “We cannot come to the relief of vulnerable communities engulfed by war when our aid workers are in bomb shelters and fleeing from attacks.” @NRC_Egeland calls for an immediate truce in #Ukraine that can end hostilities and enable life-saving relief. nre.no Immediate ceasefire needed to aid civilians in Ukraine | NRC Statement by Jan Egeland Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council: 5:43 AM - Mar 3 2022 @ 9 2 O Reply & Copylink Read 3 replies
