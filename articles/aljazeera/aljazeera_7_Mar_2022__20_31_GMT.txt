Safe passage for humanitarian aid must be guaranteed: UN UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths stressed the need to guarantee safe passage for civilians and humanitarian aid in areas of active conflict in Ukraine. “Two weeks ago few people thought the scenario we find ourselves in today was thinkable” Griffiths said. The UN humanitarian chief said civilians in places including Mariupol Kharkiv and Melitopol are in desperate need of aid especially life- saving medical supplies. Griffiths’ comments came as Security Council members worked on a resolution to address the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.
