Majority of Swedes now in favour of joining NATO: Poll A majority of Swedes are now in favour of joining NATO following Russia’s invasion according to a new opinion poll with Moscow's assault seemingly spurring a rapid shift in attitudes in a country long known for neutrality. A poll commissioned by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet showed 51 percent of Swedes are now in favour of NATO up from 42 percent in January. The number of those opposed to joining the alliance fell to 27 percent from 37 percent. The data compiled by Demoskop marks the first time any poll has shown a majority of Swedes back NATO membership. Stoltenberg said in January that Sweden could join the alliance “very quickly” if it decided to apply for membership. NATO ATO history and expansion NATO is the world’s most powerful military alliance comprising 30 members. Russia opposes NATO bases near its borders and has asked for written guarantees that NATO will not expand eastwards.
