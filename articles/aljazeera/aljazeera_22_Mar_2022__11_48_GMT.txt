‘We are on the brink of survival; Zelenskyy tells Italian parliament Ukraine’s president has told the Italian parliament that his country is on the brink of surviving its war with Russian forces but warned Moscow was intent on breaking through his country to the rest of Europe. “For Russian troops Ukraine is the gates of Europe where they want to break in but barbarism must not be allowed to pass” Zelenskyy said via video link. He also reiterated earlier calls for more sanctions to be imposed on Russia over its offensive and cautioned the consequences of the war were already being felt in other parts of the world.  0 “The most terrible thing will be the famine that is approaching for some countries.
