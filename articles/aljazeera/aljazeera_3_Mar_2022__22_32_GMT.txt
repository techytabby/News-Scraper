Russian-owned SCF oil tankers returning to Russia Two oil tankers owned and managed by Sovcomflot the Russian maritime and freight shipping company that the US blacklisted last week are rerouting from their Canadian destinations while another is returning to Russia after discharging according to tracking data and marine sources. The two tankers are the first Russian-owned oil vessels to change course after Canada this week ratcheted up pressure on Russia by shutting ports to Russian-owned ships and barring them from Canadian waters. “It’s incredibly confusing for where these ships go whether they will be received or not and if ports will accept them” said Dan Yergin vice chairman of energy research and consultancy IHS Markit.
