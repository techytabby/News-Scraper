Ex-US diplomat says NATO can do more to help Ukraine Kurt Volker the former US ambassador to NATO says the Western security alliance can do much more to help Ukraine even if it does not want to impose a no-fly zone. “There are additional air defence systems that Ukrainians need more stingers but also higher-altitude systems. They need shore-to-ship missiles to go after some of the Russian ships that are in the Black Sea firing cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities” he told Al Jazeera. “They need more Javelin anti-tank systems. The Poles have offered to provide MiG-29 aircraft which the Ukrainians know how to fly. That should happen soon. We should be accelerating our deliveries of humanitarian relief to the Ukrainian people and if that needs protection in order to do so safely we should provide that protection. There are so many things on the ladder here that we can do that we are not doing.”
