US not currently discussing importing oil from Venezuela: White House The White House has said the US is not currently discussing importing oil from Venezuela dampening speculation that Washington could look to Caracas for help amid concerns over global energy supplies due to the war in Ukraine. “It’s not an active conversation at this time” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Biden is looking for ways to relieve pressure on oil prices due to the conflict after his administration last week announced a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas. Europe is also working to become less reliant on supplies from Moscow.
