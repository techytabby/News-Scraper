US envoy to UN says claims of Ukrainians deported to Russia ‘disturbing’ US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield has said reports of thousands of residents of Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol being forcibly deported to Russia were “disturbing” and “unconscionable” if true. “T’ve only heard it. I can’t confirm it” she said on CNN. “But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.”
