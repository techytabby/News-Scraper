Israeli PM says ‘very large’ gaps remain in bid to end conflict Israel's prime minister says that while there have been advances in ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine “very large” gaps remain between the two sides. Naftali Bennett said in a speech at the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper’s conference that Israel “will continue — together with other friends in the world — to try and bridge the gap and bring an end to the war”. Israel has close relations with both Ukraine and Russia and Bennett has attempted to mediate between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. He has held multiple phone calls with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin in recent weeks and has offered to host a summit involving the pair in Jerusalem. Bennett also flew to Moscow earlier this month to meet with Putin in person.
