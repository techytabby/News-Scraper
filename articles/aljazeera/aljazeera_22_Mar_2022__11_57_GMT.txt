Kremlin says it wants Ukraine talks to be more ‘active substantive’ The Kremlin’s spokesman has said Moscow would like ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine to be more “active and substantive” after several rounds of discussions so far have failed to produce any breakthroughs on an agreement to end the war. Peskov added that Russia did not intend to make public its detailed demands to Ukraine however. Reports have suggested Moscow’s requests may include Kyiv committing to not seeking NATO membership undertaking a disarmament process ceding territory in eastern Ukraine and recognising the Crimean Peninsula — annexed by Russia in 2014 — as formally part of its neighbour.
