Chinese diplomat says NATO should have ‘been consigned to history’ Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng has said that NATO should stick to what he claimed was a promise not to expand eastward. Echoing a Kremlin talking point the diplomat said if NATO’s “enlargement goes further it would be approaching the ‘outskirts of Moscow where a missile could hit the Kremlin within seven or eight minutes”. “Pushing a major country especially a nuclear power to the corner would entail repercussions too dreadful to contemplate” he said. He expressed an understanding for Russian President Vladimir Putin's oft-repeated position saying that NATO should have disintegrated and “been consigned to history alongside the Warsaw Pact”. Norway hosts NATO military drills “However rather than breaking up NATO has kept strengthening and expanding and intervened militarily in countries like Yugoslavia Iraq Syria and Afghanistan” he said. “One could well anticipate the consequences going down this path. The crisis in Ukraine is a stern warning.” He said Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks with US President Joe Biden on Friday urged the parties in Ukraine to demonstrate “political will and keep the dialogue and negotiation going. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.”
