Russia losing high-ranking military officers Ukraine says Russia is losing high-ranking military officers in the war in Ukraine according to reports from the Ukrainian army. Mykhailo Podolyak an adviser to the Ukrainian president claimed on Twitter that six Russian generals had been killed. Russia confirmed in daily newspaper Kommersant that Black Sea fleet Deputy Commander Andrey Paliy died while fighting in the Mariupol region. Former United States military commander and CIA chief David Petraeus told CNN it was “very very very very uncommon” for generals to be killed. “The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down” Petraeus said. Be Muxaiino Noponax @ vw \ @Podolyak_M High mortality of RF senior officers is striking. Already 6 generals killed: Maj Gens Tushayev Gerasimov Kolesnikov Sukhovetsky Mityaev & Lt Gen Mordvichev. Dozens of colonels & other officers. Ie. RF army is fully unprepared & fights only with numbers & cruise missiles. 5:30 AM - Mar 20 2022 @ QO 57K © Reply & Copy link Read 215 replies
