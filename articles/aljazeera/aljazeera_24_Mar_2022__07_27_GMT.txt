UK PM says pressure could be applied to Putin's gold reserves The UK and its western allies will increase the economic pressure on Russia and are looking to see if more can be done to prevent Putin from accessing his gold reserves Johnson said. Ahead of the NATO summit the British Prime Minister told the UK’s LBC radio station that Putin had already crossed a red line and that he should appear before the International Criminal Court. “We need to do more economically” Johnson said. “Can we do more to stop him using his gold reserves for instance in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now particularly on things like gold that I believe the more we can shorten the war” he added.
