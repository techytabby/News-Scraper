Speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow Cavusoglu said “the war must stop people must not die. I came here to Moscow with this understanding today.” “We have shared our concerns in a sincere way and done our part to ease tensions and open the stage for diplomacy” he said. “We would like to host this [Putin-Zelenskyy] meeting when the situation comes to that point ... for a lasting ceasefire.” Lavrov said there were no obstacles to a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy but that it would only take place to seal a specific agreement.
