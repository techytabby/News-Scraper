Australia bans alumina exports to Russia Australia has imposed an immediate ban on exports of alumina and aluminium ores including bauxite to Russia as part of its sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20 percent of its alumina needs” the Australian government said in a statement adding that the move will limit Russia’s capacity to produce aluminium which is a critical export for Russia. The government also said it will donate at least 70000 tonnes of thermal coal to Ukraine to meet its energy needs.
