Zelenskyy urges no-fly zone in address to Canada’s parliament Ukraine needs a no-fly zone to stop Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Canada’s parliament as Western leaders continue to rule out directly intervening in the conflict. Addressing the House of Commons in Ottawa via video on Tuesday morning Zelenskyy said Ukraine has experienced 20 days of “full-scale aggression” by Russia. “Can you imagine when you call your [allies] and you ask please close the sky close the airspace please stop the bombings how many more cruise missiles have to fall on our cities until you make this happen? And in return they express their deep concerns about the situation” he said. “Please understand how important it is for us to close our airspace from Russian missiles and Russian aircraft. I hope you can understand.” aine steps up its no-fly zone calls with ‘Paris attack’ video... lad Or Ukraine steps up no-fly zone calls
