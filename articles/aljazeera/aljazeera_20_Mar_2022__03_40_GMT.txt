Zelenskyy calls Russian siege of Mariupol a ‘war crime’ Ukraine’s president says the siege of Mariupol will go down in history for what he is calling “war crimes” by Russia’s military. “To do this to a peaceful city what the occupiers did is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come” he said in his night-time video address to the nation. Russia’s military is not even recovering the bodies of its soldiers in some places Zelenskyy said. “In places where there were especially fierce battles the bodies of Russian soldiers simply pile up along our line of defence. And no one is collecting these bodies” he said.
