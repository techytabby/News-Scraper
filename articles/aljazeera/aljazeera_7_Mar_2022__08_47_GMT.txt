China says friendship with Russia is ‘rock solid’ China’s friendship with Russia is “rock solid” and the prospects for cooperation between Moscow and Beijing are very broad the country’s foreign minister has said. Wang Yi’s remarks delivered at a news conference on the sidelines of China’s annual meeting of parliament come after Beijing signalled last week that it was ready to play a role in brokering a ceasefire. Until now China’s government has attempted to strike a delicate balancing act over Moscow’s incursion. It has refrained from calling Russia's attack an “invasion” and neither openly denounced nor supported the move.
