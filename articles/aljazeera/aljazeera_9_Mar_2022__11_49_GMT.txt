Kuleba cool on expectations ahead of talks with Lavrov Ukraine’s foreign minister says he has limited expectations for planned talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Dmytro Kuleba confirmed in a video statement that the pair would hold discussions in Turkey on Thursday and urged Lavrov to approach the talks “in good faith not from a propagandistic perspective”. “But I will say frankly that my expectations of the talks are low” he added. “We are interested in a ceasefire liberating our territories and the third point is to resolve all humanitarian issues.”
