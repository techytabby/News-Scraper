NATO believes Russian offensive ‘largely stalled’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s James Bays reporting from NATO’s headquarters in Brussels says the alliance believes Russia’s offensive has “largely stalled” with Moscow suffering a “great deal of losses”. Citing an unnamed senior military official from the alliance Bays said NATO estimates between 7000-15000 Russian troops have been killed. “But they say when you take into account the number that have been wounded or captured then the number of Russian troops who are no longer able to fight could be 30000-40000” he added. However Bays also said the same official believes the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol could fall under Russian control within “days”. “Clearly that would be very important for the state of the battlefield and it would be an important but very barbaric victory by Russia” he added. “Mariupol ... is so strategically important in the fight because it gives the access to the coast from Crimea to the Donbas.” Qne month in Russia‘s war in Ukraine -has.no end in sight ‘UKRAINE WAR __ /Russian Taide Kolar lake a aarelal ny
