Road out of Mariupol mined: Red Cross The Red Cross has said that its staff along with other civilians were unable to leave Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol because of the resumption of hostilities and the lack of a safe exit route. Dominik Stillhart director of operations at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told BBC radio that the team had attempted to leave on Sunday but realised the road indicated to them was mined. Two attempts at evacuating civilians from Mariupol failed during the weekend as both Ukrainians and Russians blamed each other for violating a previously agreed ceasefire.
