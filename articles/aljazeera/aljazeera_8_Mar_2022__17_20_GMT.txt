Zelenskyy addresses UK parliament calls for support Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was given a standing ovation in a historic address to British parliamentarians. The Ukrainian president pushed for more Western action against Russia and called for humanitarian aid. Paraphrasing Shakespeare and Winston Churchill Zelenskyy said Ukrainians will continue to resist the Russian invasion and urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to enact further sanctions against Russia and declare it a terrorist state. He also called for a no-fly zone which NATO so far refused to impose.
