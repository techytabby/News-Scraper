A no-fly zone is a ‘military operation’: Analyst A US-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine would effectively be a “military operation” that risks escalating the conflict Alyssa Demus a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation think-tank has said. “In theory it sounds like a good idea” Demus told Al Jazeera. “But then when you get into the nitty-gritty of what a no-fly zone means in practice it really is a military operation. So I think Russia would perceive that as a pretty significant escalation and they're a nuclear state.”
