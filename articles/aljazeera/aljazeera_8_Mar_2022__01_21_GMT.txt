Russia says ceasefire evacuations to begin Tuesday Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has told a UN Security Council (UNSC) meeting his country will observe a ceasefire on Tuesday at 10am Moscow time (07:00 GMT) and open humanitarian corridors to evacuate citizens from Kyiv and several other cities. Zelenskyy had rejected earlier proposals to evacuate Ukrainian citizens into what he called “occupied territory” in Russia and Belarus. “This proposal doesn’t have any demands about the citizens being sent necessarily to Russia into Russian territory” Nebenzia said. “There’s also evacuation offered towards Ukrainian cities to the west of Kyiv and ultimately it will be the choice of the people themselves where they want to be evacuated to.” RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR Where are people fleeing to? The UN says more than 1.7 million people mostly women and children fled Ukraine since Russia invaded. Most sought refuge in neighbouring countries.
