‘Constant bombardment’ in Kharkiv Standing on a street strewn with rubble and destroyed buildings Al Jazeera's Assed Baig said Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv has been facing constant bombardment. “We've heard heavy artillery firing all morning and all afternoon” he said. “This is what Ukrainians here are facing: constant bombing missile strikes shelling [and] heavy artillery.” Standing in front of a courthouse that was targeted a few days ago Baig said the impact of the shelling took out windows. “On the opposite side of the street was residences again completely destroyed. Workmen are actually working now to clear the drains from the rubble. We understand that behind that is a military police building. The Russians actually missed that and hit a residence building where two people died and five others [were] injured.” According to Kharkiv’s mayor more than 600 buildings including schools and hospitals were destroyed.
