Analysts see 39 percent decline in Ukraine 2022 spring grain sowing area The area sown with Ukraine’s 2022 spring grain crops could fall 39 percent to 4.7 million hectares (11.6 million acres) due to Russia’s military invasion the APK-Inform agriculture consultancy has said. The country which harvested a record 86 million tonnes of grain in 2021 sowed 7.7 million hectares (19 million acres) of spring grains last year. “After the invasion of Russian troops into the territory of Ukraine and as a result of ongoing and further active hostilities in many key regions there is no physical opportunity to start sowing” APK-Inform said in a report.
