Ceasefire call by Russia a ‘fiction’: Writer A UK-based author says Russia’s announcement of the ceasefire in Mariupol was a “fiction” adding Moscow was following a “script” similar to its actions in Syria. “Russia has repeated a very familiar script to set these [ceasefires] up and entice people into leaving the city into evacuating through what was supposed to be a safe corridor and then tried to shell them in order to bottleneck as many people as possible into an area that was going to come under attack” Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in London told Al Jazeera from Northamptonshire. “Fortunately it appears that Ukrainian authorities — who already let’s not forget have been at war with Russia for eight years and probably knew what was coming held back from actually launching all of their civilian evacuees down this humanitarian corridor” he added.
