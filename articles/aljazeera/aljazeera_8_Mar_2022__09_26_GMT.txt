Humanitarian corridors a ‘confused picture’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine has described the situation with humanitarian corridors as a “confused picture”. “The Ukrainians say just one route out of Sumy [has been set up] as part of a sort of negotiated agreement on routes of evacuation” Hull said. “The whole humanitarian corridor issue has been rather foggy up to now ... two negotiated attempts at corridors out of Mariupol and Volnovakha fell apart on Saturday and Sunday with each side blaming the other for the breakdown of those” he added. “Then on Monday there was this unilateral offer by Russia to offer a series of routes out of big populated and bombarded urban centres — places like Kyiv Kharkiv Mariupol and Sumy — [but] nothing came of that. “They were routes that led directly into Russia and into Russian-allied Belarus and denounced as cynical unacceptable and ‘immoral’ by the Ukrainian side.” TAN BMS Co eee Lhe
