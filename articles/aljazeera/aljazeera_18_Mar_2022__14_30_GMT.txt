Russia will respond to Bulgaria's ‘hostile’ expulsion of diplomats The Russian embassy to Sofia has said Bulgaria’s decision to expel 10 Russian diplomats was “yet another aggressive step” to which Moscow would respond accordingly. Ina statement on its Telegram channel the embassy said it saw the expulsions as a sign of Bulgaria’s intention to cut Bulgarian-Russian relations to a minimum. “This hostile demarche will soon get a relevant appraisal and a reaction adequate to the new spirit of the bilateral relations” the embassy said.
