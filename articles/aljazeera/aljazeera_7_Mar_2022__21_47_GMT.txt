War not going as Russia planned: UK ambassador to US Karen Pierce the UK ambassador to the US has suggested that the invasion of Ukraine is not going as planned for Russia saying that Moscow has been met with transatlantic unity and Ukrainian resistance. “Tf I sat in Moscow and I were an advisor to President Putin I would be interested in the fact that because of this invasion of Ukraine more and more countries want a relationship with NATO. NATO members have been brought closer together” Pierce told Al Jazeera in an interview. “The US and Europe have been united in their economic approach and NATO forces — although only on NATO territory — have been brought closer to the borders of Russia proper. And Ukrainians have really found their identity whereas President Putin thought he would be welcomed. Sign up for Al Jazeera Weekly Newsletter The latest news from around the world. Timely. Accurate.
