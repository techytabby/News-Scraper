Ukraine tennis star Yastremska: ‘Spirit strong’ after reaching Lyon final Ukrainian tennis player Dayana Yastremska who was forced to flee her home last week said her spirit was strong after reaching the final of the Lyon Open. The world number 128 beat Romania's Sorana Cirstea 7-6(5) 4-6 6-4 over the course of two hours 31 minutes in a hard-fought victory at the WTA 250 event on Saturday.
