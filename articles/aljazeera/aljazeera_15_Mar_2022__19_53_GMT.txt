Biden signs budget bill providing additional aid to Ukraine US President Joe Biden has signed a bill providing $13.6bn in additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion government spending measure. “Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has uniting people all across America united our two parties in Congress and united the freedom loving world” Biden said. Roughly half the $13.6bn will arm Ukraine and cover the Pentagon’s costs for sending US troops to other Eastern European nations that might see the war spill past their borders. Much of the rest will be allocated to humanitarian and economic assistance strengthening regional allies’ defences and protecting their energy supplies and cybersecurity needs.
