US Congress moves to revoke Russia's ‘most favoured nation’ trade status The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved legislation to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trading status bringing the US closer to imposing higher tariffs and restrictions on Russian imports. The House’s 428-8 vote sends the bill requested by President Biden to the Senate for likely approval as soon as next week. The bill also would allow Biden to impose more penalties on Russian officials under the US’s Global Magnitsky Sanctions law.
