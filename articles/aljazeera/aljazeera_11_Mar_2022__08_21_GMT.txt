Attacks target cities across Ukraine: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine says Russian attacks have taken place in major urban centres across Ukraine. “In Kharkiv to the east ... the institute of physics and technology was narrowly missed by air strikes — it houses an experimental nuclear reactor” Hull said. “In Chernihiv in the north critical infrastructure came under attack ... a water pipeline was said to have been hit there and in Lutsk to the northeast of Kyiv and Ivano-Frankivsk pretty close to where I am here ... military airfields have been struck by air strikes as part of an ongoing effort by the Russians to impede the ability of Ukraine’s air force and air defences to operate” he added.
