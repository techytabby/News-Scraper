Klitschko accuses Russia of targeting city mayors Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has accused Russia of “terrorism” for targeting elected officials in Ukraine and insisted Moscow’s forces would be “kicked out of every inch of our land”. The comments come after a senior Ukrainian official shared a video that he said shows armed men carrying Ivan Fedorov the mayor of the city of Melitopol across a square. “Occupiers left the city without its elected leader to paralyse Melitopol’s life support and thus demoralise and conquer local residents” Klitschko said. “This is an act of terrorism.” People protest the abduction of Mayor Ivan Fedorov outside the Melitopol regional administration building after he was reportedly taken away by Russian forces in Melitopol Ukraine [Courtesy of Deputy Head for President's Office Ukraine/Handout via Reuters]
