Interior minister: ‘No safe place in Ukraine’ Ukraine’s Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky has said that Russian spies and diversion groups are omnipresent throughout Ukraine. “Unfortunately there are no places in Ukraine without an obvious military threat. We can’t name a region where there has been no shelling or where we haven't found diversion groups” he was quoted by the Unian news agency as saying. He said that such groups or fire spotters are detained almost daily in Kyiv and are present even in the western Ukrainian regions where hostilities have been limited to rare cruise missile strikes on strategic sites such as military bases or airports. “The problem is everywhere” Monastyrsky said.
