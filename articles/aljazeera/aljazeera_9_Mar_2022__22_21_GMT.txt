Ukrainian MP says people forced to drink ‘contaminated water’ Ukrainian Member of Parliament Lesia Vasylenko says it is currently impossible for many Ukrainians to access clean water amid the fighting forcing many to drink contaminated water and causing several cases of dehydration. “It’s impossible to get food or water” Vasylenko told Al Jazeera. “People are drinking contaminated water from the sewage system or children are forced to take snow or what remains of the snow just to stay hydrated.” The situation she added demonstrates “how inhumane” the methods Russia is using against the Ukrainian civilian population are.
