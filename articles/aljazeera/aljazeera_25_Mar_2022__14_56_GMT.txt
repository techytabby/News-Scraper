Switzerland adopts more EU sanctions against Russia Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow. “This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented” the country’s cabinet said in a statement. However the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today. “Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast” it added.
