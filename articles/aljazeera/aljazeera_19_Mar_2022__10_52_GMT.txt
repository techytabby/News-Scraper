Switzerland brands war in Ukraine ‘devastating madness’ Russia's war in Ukraine is driven by “devastating madness” and Switzerland is prepared to pay the price for defending freedom and democracy Swiss President Ignazio Cassis says. Switzerland imposed the same sanctions on Russia as the EU but Cassis insisted Switzerland’s neutrality was not at stake. However he said Switzerland could not simply stand by in the “confrontation between democracy and barbarism” and was prepared to take an economic hit. “On February 24 the face of the world changed and not in a good way. We must valiantly and tirelessly defend freedom and democracy. This has a price. A price that Switzerland is ready to assume” he wrote in Le Temps newspaper. “This war is driven by a devastating madness which shatters all the principles and values of our civilisation.”
