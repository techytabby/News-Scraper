Russia default on debt is ‘imminent’: Fitch Ratings agency Fitch has again downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt rating further into junk territory from “B” to “C” saying the decision reflects the view that a default is “imminent”. It justified the further downgrade by saying recent developments had “further undermined Russia's willingness to service government debt”.
