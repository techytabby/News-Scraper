Navalny calls for anti-war protests across Russia on Sunday Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has called for anti-war protests in Russia’s capital Moscow and other cities across the country on Sunday. “Mad maniac Putin will most quickly be stopped by the people of Russia now if they oppose the war” Navalny said in a message posted on his Instagram account. “You need to go to anti-war rallies every weekend even if it seems that everyone has either left or got scared ... You are the backbone of the movement against war and death” he added. More than 13900 people have been arrested for taking part in a string of anti-war demonstrations held in dozens of cities throughout Russia since it began its offensive according to protest monitoring group OVD-Info.
