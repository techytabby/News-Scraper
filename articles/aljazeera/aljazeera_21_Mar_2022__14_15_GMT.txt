Russian troops open fire at protesters in Kherson: Reports Russian troops have fired on a crowd of protesters in Kherson wounding several people according to local media reports. Footage posted on social media appeared to show demonstrators gathering in the southern Ukrainian city’s main square. The sound of automatic gunfire could be heard and people were seen running. Some reports said Russian forces used stun grenades. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the reports or the video footage. Kherson has witnessed regular anti-Russia protests since Moscow’s forces took control of the city at the beginning of March — the most strategically significant capture of Ukrainian territory yet.
