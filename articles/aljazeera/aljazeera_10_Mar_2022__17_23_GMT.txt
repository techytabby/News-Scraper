Russian forces encircle at least four major cities Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains under Ukrainian control despite heavy bombardments though Western observers point to a Russian column of hundreds of vehicles outside the city. The city of Sumy in northeast Ukraine is now encircled by Russian troops but thousands have been able to leave through a humanitarian corridor. Ukrainian forces also retain control of the northern town of Chernihiv which has seen heavy civilian casualties in recent days and appears to be encircled. Kharkiv remains in Ukrainian hands despite increasingly intense Russian bombardment and the city is likely now surrounded.
