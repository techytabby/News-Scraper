Navalny calls for March 6 protests in Russia across the world Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has called on Russians to protest against the war in Ukraine in cities across Russia and the world on March 6. “Show the world that Russians don’t want war. Come out in the squares of Berlin New York Amsterdam or Melbourne wherever you are. Now we are all responsible for Russia’s future. For what Russia will be in the eyes of the world” Navalny said in a post on his blog. “You may be scared but to submit to this fear is to side with fascists and murderers. Putin has already snatched away from Russia its economy relations with the world and hope for a future” he added. Several rounds of anti-war protests have already taken place in cities across Russia. More than 8000 people have been arrested for taking part in the demonstrations according to protest monitoring group OVD-Info.
