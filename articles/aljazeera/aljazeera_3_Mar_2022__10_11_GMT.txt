Kremlin hails Russian troops as ‘heroes’ The Kremlin has praised Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as “heroes” who will go down in history alongside the soldiers who defeated Nazi Germany in World War II. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the remarks at a news briefing during which he also dismissed reports that Moscow may be planning to introduce martial law. Peskov said Putin will hold a security council meeting later today. On Wednesday Moscow said that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1597 others wounded as it announced its own death toll for the first time. Zelenskyy on Thursday said about 9000 Russian troops had been killed. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify either of the figures provided.
