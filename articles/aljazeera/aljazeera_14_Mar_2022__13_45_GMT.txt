Russia accuses Ukraine of missile strike on Donetsk; Ukraine denies Russia's defence ministry has said 20 people have been killed and 28 wounded by a Ukrainian missile with a cluster charge in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine denied launching the attack. “It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition; there’s not even any point talking about it” Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin told a televised briefing. Pro-Russian separatists who control part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said earlier that a child was among those hit in the alleged strike and accused Kyiv of committing a war crime.
