Sanctions on Russia not linked with Iran nuclear talks: Blinken The sanctions imposed on Russia over its Ukraine invasion have nothing to do with a potential nuclear deal with Iran US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. The comment follows Russia’s demand on Saturday for written guarantees from Washington that its punitive measures would not harm cooperation on Iran. In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation show Blinken said “the sanctions that have been put in place ... on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement. “These things are totally different and just are not in any way linked together” he said.
