Russia says Mariupol hospital attack ‘staged’ by Ukraine The Russian army has claimed an attack on a children’s hospital in Mariupol was a “staged provocation” by Ukraine. “The Russian aviation carried out absolutely no missions to hit targets on the ground in the Mariupol area” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. “The airstrike that allegedly took place is a completely staged provocation to maintain anti-Russian hype for a Western audience.”
