France warns Russia against use of chemical weapons French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says Paris would consider Russia responsible for any use of chemical or biological weapons in the war in Ukraine. “If chemical or bacteriological attacks took place in Ukraine we'd know who would be solely responsible for them. It would be Russia” Le Drian told French newspaper Le Parisien in an interview. “The use of unconventional means would constitute an intolerable escalation and would lead in response to absolutely massive and radical economic sanctions without taboos” he added.
