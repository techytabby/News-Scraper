Russia ‘failed’ to achieve objectives in Ukraine US says Russia has failed to achieve its goals in Ukraine Sullivan has said stressing that Moscow will “never take the country away from the Ukrainian people”. Biden’s national security adviser told reporters at the White House that Russia had set three “basic” objectives for itself when it started the invasion: subjugating Ukraine enhancing Moscow's power and prestige and dividing the West. “Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives. In fact it has thus far achieved the opposite” the top aide said. Still Sullivan predicted that violence will get worse in the coming days warning that the war will not end easily.
