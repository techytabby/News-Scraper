Russia ‘underestimated’ Ukrainian resistance: US intelligence chief US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has said Russia is facing setbacks in its invasion of Ukraine. “We assess Moscow underestimated the strength of Ukraine’s resistance and the degree of internal military challenges we are observing which include an ill-constructed plan morale issues and considerable logistical issues” Haines told US lawmakers during a hearing. She added that it remains unclear whether Russia will pursue a maximalist plan of capturing all of Ukraine and if it does it will be “especially challenging” for Moscow to hold and control the country. Haines also accused Russian forces of displaying disregard for civilians in Ukraine and said the US intelligence community was working to document Moscow’s abuses.
