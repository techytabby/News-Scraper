Kherson mayor says Russian troops in the streets Igor Kolykhayev Kherson’s mayor has said that Russian troops are in the city’s streets and have forced their way into its council building according to a report by Reuters. Kolykhayev urged Russian soldiers not to shoot civilians and called on residents to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos. “We do not have the Armed Forces in the city only civilians and people who want to LIVE here!” he said in a statement. Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Kherson is under Russian soldiers’ “complete control” and the city’s civilian infrastructure facilities and transport are operating as usual with no shortages of any essential goods. Ukraine’s government had earlier played down reports that Kherson had fallen to Russia.
