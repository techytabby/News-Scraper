Spanish Slovenian PMs accuse Russia of ‘war crimes’ over hospital bombing The prime ministers of Spain and Slovenia have separately accused Moscow of committing “war crimes” in Ukraine. “We're seeing how hospitals are being bombed. They are attacking civil society in an indiscriminate manner therefore clearly violating human rights and more than likely committing war crimes” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said during a visit to a Ukrainian refugee centre near Madrid. His remarks were echoed by Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa who also accused Russia of committing “war crimes” over the hospital bombing in Mariupol. “Anyone one can see that it is against all conventions” Jansa said as he arrived at a meeting of the European People’s Party in Paris. Russia has refuted Ukrainian assertions that the site in Mariupol was still functioning as a hospital claiming it had been taken over by troops [Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]
