‘Violence increasing every hour’: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine says there has been “no let-up in the scale of the violence” as Russia’s assault enters its second week. “In fact it is increasing every hour it would seem” Simmons said. “[The capture of] Kherson marks the first city in Ukraine to fall to the Russians and in doing so it has devastated some level of morale [there]” he added. “Ukrainian forces are nowhere to be seen in the city ... [and] further down the coast in Mariupol the situation is just extraordinary. “There is no food no water no fuel and very little hope for people [there]. Some were getting out at the last minute as convoys with tanks came the other way. But there are awful scenes from the city and the pressure on local hospitals is intense. There has been just no sparing of anything in the way the city has been shelled.” Moscow claims it is only targeting military infrastructure but reports from the ground suggest a mounting civilian death toll [File: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]
