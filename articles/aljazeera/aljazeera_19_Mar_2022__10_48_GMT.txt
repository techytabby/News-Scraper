UK fears ‘more extreme’ Russian actions in Ukraine Peace talks to end the Ukraine conflict could be a “smokescreen” for more extreme Russian military manoeuvres British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned. “Tm very sceptical” Truss told The Times newspaper in an interview. “What we've seen is an attempt to create space for the Russians to regroup. Their invasion isn’t going according to plan. I fear the negotiation is yet another attempt to create a diversion and create a smokescreen. I don’t think we're yet at a point for negotiation.” Truss echoed comments by British intelligence that President Putin could turn to “more and more extreme actions” adding “we've seen appalling atrocities already.”
