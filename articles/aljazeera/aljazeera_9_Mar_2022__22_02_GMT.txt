UN humanitarian chief decries strike on hospital as ‘deeply shocking’ The UN’s humanitarian affairs chief has denounced the attack on a Ukrainian children’s hospital in Mariupol as an “appalling breach” of international humanitarian law. “It’s deeply shocking in all kinds of different ways. It’s shocking because it’s a medical facility which under international humanitarian law is protected” Martin Griffiths told Al Jazeera. “It’s shocking because it kills babies newborns and it’s shocking because this is the kind of thing that happens appallingly in the war like the one we are seeing in Ukraine. He added: “I hope we will find out in due course who did this and hold them to account.” PP amanda Price @ y by @amandaruthprice UN Relief Chief Martin Griffiths speaks to @AJEnglish about the humanitarian crisis brought on by the war in #Ukraine as well as the ""deeply deeply shocking"" attack ona children's hospital in Mariupol: A oe re oer neon 1:45 PM - Mar 9 2022 @® © 60 F See the latest COVID-19 information on Twitter Read 7 replies
