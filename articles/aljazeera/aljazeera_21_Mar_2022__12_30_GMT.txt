Egyptian pound drops nearly 14 percent after Ukraine war prompts dollar flight Egypt’s pound has depreciated by almost 14 percent after weeks of pressure on the currency as foreign investors pulled out billions of dollars from Egyptian treasury markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The pound dropped to 18.17-18.27 against the dollar Refinitiv data showed after having traded at around 15.7 pounds to the dollar since November 2020. The downturn is likely to have a heavy toll on poor and middle-class Egyptians and came after the country’s central bank hiked interest rates by 100 basis points in a surprise overnight monetary policy meeting. The central bank cited inflationary pressures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine which hiked oil prices to new records as the basis for its decision.
