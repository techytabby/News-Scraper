What weapons is the US sending to Ukraine? The new arms and equipment Biden announced for Ukraine earlier includes S-300 long-range missile defence systems that can strike fighter jets that are much further away according to AFP. The US is also giving Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones which are essentially camera-equipped remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator. Other arms include 800 Stingers which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles and 2000 Javelins also shoulder- mounted weapons that have proven particularly effective at defeating Russian tanks’ anti-missile defences.
