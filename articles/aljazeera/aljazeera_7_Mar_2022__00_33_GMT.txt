Two big-name accounting firms to leave Russia Two of the so-called Big Four accounting firms - KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers — are pulling out of Russia over its war in Ukraine. Both firms said they would end their relationships with their Russia- based member firms. KPMG said it was also pulling out of Belarus. KPMG International said in a statement it would be “incredibly difficult” to have its Russia and Belarus firms leave the network. KPMG has more than 4500 employees in the two countries. PricewaterhouseCoopers said it has 3700 employees at its PwC Russia firm and is working on an “orderly transition” for the business.
