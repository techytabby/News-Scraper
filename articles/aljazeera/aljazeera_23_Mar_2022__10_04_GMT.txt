Kremlin warns NATO peacekeepers idea is extremely dangerous The Kremlin’s spokesman has cautioned that any possible contact between the Russian military and NATO forces could have grave consequences after Poland last week said the alliance should send peacekeepers to Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov said Warsaw's idea was “reckless and extremely dangerous”. “Any possible confrontation between our troops and NATO forces could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair” he told reporters.
