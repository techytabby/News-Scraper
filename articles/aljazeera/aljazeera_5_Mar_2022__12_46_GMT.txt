Poroshenko calls on West for Ukraine no- fly zone Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called on the West to provide his country with more weapons to fight Russian invasion forces. He was speaking during a visit to Ukrainian troops who were helping civilians from the outskirts of the capital Kyiv to reach the city centre to be evacuated by train. The troops guided civilians across a river where a bridge had been destroyed by the fighting. Poroshenko also demanded that Putin be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for launching the invasion and reiterated calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
