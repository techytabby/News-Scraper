Germany to host G7 meeting over food security Germany will host a virtual meeting of agricultural ministers from G7 countries on Friday to discuss the effect of the invasion on global food security and how to best stabilise food markets the government says. “The provision of foodstuffs in Germany and the European Union is safe but greater shortages can be expected in some countries outside the EU - especially where scarcity already reigns today due to issues like drought” German Agriculture Minister Cem Oezdemir said. “Price hikes for agricultural products cannot be excluded in industrialised nations either.” Pol eeedates tt sisii=))o)-1 tt Nem NM terse Cy ALJAZEERA UKRAINE WET g
