Hungary asks for EU funds amid refugee crisis Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has asked the European Commission to disburse all European Union funds allocated to the country including a loan under the Recovery and Resilience Facility to help handle the Ukrainian refugee crisis his press chief has said. Orban said Hungary wanted to use the loan facility for defence border control and humanitarian and other acute crisis management tasks according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters. The European Commission has been withholding its approval to pay out pandemic recovery money to Poland and Hungary because the two countries have yet to address EU recommendations on the rule of law including press freedoms and LGBT rights.
