UK to phase out Russian oil imports by end of 2022 The United Kingdom will phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. “In another economic blow to the Putin regime following their illegal invasion of Ukraine the UK will move away from dependence on Russian oil throughout this year building on our severe package of international economic sanctions” Johnson said in a statement. “We are confident that this can be achieved over the course of the year providing enough time for companies to adjust and ensuring consumers are protected.”
