‘Never heard of that’: China responds to reports Russia sought military help The spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington has responded to media reports that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since launching its invasion of Ukraine by saying “I’ve never heard of that.” The spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China’s priority was to prevent the tense situation in Ukraine from getting out of control. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting” he said in an emailed response to an inquiry from the Reuters news agency. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”
