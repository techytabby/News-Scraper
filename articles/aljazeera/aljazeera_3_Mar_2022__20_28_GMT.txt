US senators propose ban on Russian oil imports A bipartisan group of US senators has introduced legislation that would ban all oil imports to the US from Russia. “Energy has been weaponised. We have the ability to counter that weapon” said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who is part of a group calling on the Biden administration to boost US domestic oil production. The proposal titled the “Ban Russian Energy Imports Act” also has the support of the top leader in the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. But White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at an earlier media briefing that White House officials opposed blocking Russian oil imports because it would raise fuel prices for Americans.
