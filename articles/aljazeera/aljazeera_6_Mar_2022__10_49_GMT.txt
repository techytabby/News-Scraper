France urges UK to do more to help Ukraine refugees in Calais French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has urged the United Kingdom to do more to help Ukrainian refugees stuck in the French port of Calais saying UK officials were turning many away due to not having the necessary visas or paperwork. “T have twice contacted my British counterpart I told her to set up a consulate in Calais” Darmanin told Europe 1 radio referring to British Home Secretary Priti Patel. “We have good relations with [Patel]. I am sure she is a decent person. I am sure she will solve this problem” he added. Darmanin said hundreds of Ukrainian refugees had arrived at Calais in the last few days hoping to join their families in the UK but that many had been turned away by British officials and told to obtain visas at UK consulates in Paris or Brussels.
