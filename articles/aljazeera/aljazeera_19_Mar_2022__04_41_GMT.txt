Ukraine says ‘temporarily’ lost access to Sea of Azov Ukraine’s defence ministry has said it has lost access to the Sea of Azov “temporarily” as Russian forces tightened their grip around the besieged port city of Mariupol. “The occupiers have partially succeeded in the Donetsk operational district temporarily depriving Ukraine of access to the Sea of Azov” Ukraine’s defence ministry said in a statement late on Friday. The ministry did not say whether or when Ukraine’s forces had regained access to the sea.
