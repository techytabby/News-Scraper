Pope asserts Ukraine right to defence in blasting Russia war Roman Catholic Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity history and tradition” and were “defending their land.” Francis’s comments in a message to a gathering of European Catholic representatives marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia's invasion. It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace not politics.
