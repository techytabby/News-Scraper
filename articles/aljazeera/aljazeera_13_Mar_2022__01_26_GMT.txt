UK to pay people $450 a month to open their homes to Ukraine refugees The United Kingdom will pay people to open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion as the government moves to deflect anger about its response to the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The new scheme called “Homes for Ukraine” will let refugees from the war come to the UK even if they do not have family ties the government said. The country will pay people 350 pounds ($456) a month if they can offer refugees a spare room or property for a minimum period of six months.
