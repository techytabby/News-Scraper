Russia's initial campaign to seize Kyiv force regime change ‘has failed’: ISW The Institute for the Study of War says the initial Russian campaign to seize Ukraine’s capital and force regime change has failed. “The doctrinally sound Russian response to this situation would be to end this campaign accept a possibly lengthy operational pause develop the plan for a new campaign build up resources for that new campaign and launch it when the resources and other conditions are ready” the United States-based group said. But the Russian military has not yet adopted this approach and continues efforts to restore momentum to this “culminated campaign” the ISW said. This is creating conditions of “stalemate throughout most of Ukraine” a bloody phase that could last for weeks or months it added.
