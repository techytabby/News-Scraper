WHO fears more vulnerable refugees could flee Ukraine The next wave of refugees to flee Ukraine is likely to be even more vulnerable to illness and economic hardship than the one million people who have already left a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official has said. Speaking from a warehouse in Warsaw Poland where the WHO is coordinating the delivery of 36 tonnes of medical aid to Ukraine Europe Director Hans Kluge said the “humanitarian catastrophe” was set to worsen as Russian troops surround and bombard major Ukrainian cities. “If the military conflict escalates that means we are going to see more and more very vulnerable people coming with only the clothes on their body” Kluge told the Reuters news agency. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR Where are people fleeing to? At least one million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion according to the United Nations. Most are women and children. Many have sought refuge in Poland and other neighbouring states. PE eos   msn"" ss DONETSK Odesa Kherson Mariupol oe Die CRIMEA Wt Sevastopol a “i Wack Sy @Alebs TN
