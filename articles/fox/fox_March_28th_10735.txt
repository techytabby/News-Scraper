Mariupol mayor: 160000 people remain here as Russian military preventing evacuations Destroyed cars are seen in front of a damaged apartment building in Mariupol on Sunday. (Reuters) Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko wrote on Telegram Monday that around 160000 people remain in the besieged Ukrainian port city. Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne quoted him as saying that Russian forces were preventing civilians from evacuating Mariupol and had been turning back some who tried to make it out. The city which had a pre-war population of more than 400000 has seen some of the worst conditions since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb.24. Russian forces have pounded Mariupol and scores of civilians have been unable to escape with no access to essentials and cut off from communication with the shelling of cell radio and TV towers.
