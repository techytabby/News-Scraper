Blinken: U.S. is not seeking regime change in Russia Secretary of State Antony Blinken clarified the U.S. is not seeking regime change in Russia. The clarification comes a day after President Biden said during a speech in Warsaw Poland that Russian President Viadimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” Blinken said during a news conference in Jerusalem that Biden's point was “Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.” “We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else for that matter” the top U.S. official added. And: “In this case as in any case it’s up to the people of the country in question. It's up to the Russian people.” The Associated Press contributed to this report. Posted by Lawrence Richard a
