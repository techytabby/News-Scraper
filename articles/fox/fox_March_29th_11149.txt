Ukrainian forces potentially strike back in Russia for the first time Ukrainian forces shelled a Russian military camp inside Russia according to reporting from the New York Post. Such a strike would be the first time Ukraine struck Russia on the other side of the border. The strike hit the military camp near the Russian city of Belgorod which sits about 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv near the Russian border. Video posted online of the reported attack appeared to show ammunition blowing up though the source of the explosion has yet to be confirmed. Four people were reportedly injured in the explosion.
