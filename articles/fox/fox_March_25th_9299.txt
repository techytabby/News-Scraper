Biden will likely discuss the matter with Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in Brussels before heading to Warsaw on Friday. Getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult even though the U.S. has been dramatically increasing its exports in recent years. Many export facilities are already operating at capacity and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages. Most liquefied natural gas from the U.S. already goes to Europe. On Thursday Biden pledged new sanctions on Moscow and said Russian President Vladimir Putin should be expelled from the G20. He added that the U.S. plans to provide more humanitarian aid to Ukraine and is willing to accept up to 100000 refugees. Posted by Brie Stimson &
