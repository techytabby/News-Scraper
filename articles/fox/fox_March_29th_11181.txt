Pentagon says Russians ‘failed to take Kyi Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said that the Russians have failed to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv which he said was an objective for their forces. Kirby said that a small number of Russian troops are now moving away from Kyiv though he wouldnt classify it as a retreat or withdrawal of forces and Kyiv continues to be the target of air strikes. The press secretary also noted that the Russians have failed in their objective to take most Ukrainian population centers in large part because of fierce Ukrainian resistance.
