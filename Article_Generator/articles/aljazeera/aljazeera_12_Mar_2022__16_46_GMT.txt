Ukrainian FM says ready to negotiate but not surrender Ukraine was ready to negotiate to end the war but would not surrender or accept any ultimatums said the country’s foreign affairs minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We will continue to fight. We are ready to negotiate but we are not going to accept any ultimatums and surrender” Kuleba said adding that Russia was putting forward demands that were “unacceptable”. Speaking at a virtual event organised by the nonpartisan nonprofit organisation Renew Democracy Initiative Kuleba also said civilian lives would be saved if Ukraine had fighter jets and more attack planes to destroy large military columns.
