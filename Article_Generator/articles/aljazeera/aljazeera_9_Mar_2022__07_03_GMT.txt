Russia says Ukraine planned attack on rebel region in March Russia’s defence ministry has said it has obtained secret documents which prove that Ukraine planned a March attack on Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The ministry published six pages of documents that it claimed showed Kyiv planned a military assault on the Russian-backed rebel republics in the Donbas region. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the documents — written in Ukrainian — which appear to outline combat preparations for tactical military units.
