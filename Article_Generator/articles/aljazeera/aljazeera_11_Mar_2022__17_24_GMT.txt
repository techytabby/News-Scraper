‘Utter nonsense’: UK envoy to UN slams Russian ‘disinformation’ The British ambassador to the UN has slammed Russia's claim that Ukraine has a biological weapons programme as “yet another lie”. “Russia has today brought into the Security Council a series of wild completely baseless and irresponsible conspiracy theories. They are utter nonsense” Barbara Woodward said during an emergency meeting. “There is not a shred of credible evidence that Ukraine has a biological weapons programme... This is yet another lie in Russia’s disinformation campaign.”
