Germany's Scholz rejects sending warplanes to Ukraine German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out sending warplanes to Ukraine after the United States turned down an offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to a US base in Germany with a view to them then being passed on to Kyiv. “We have provided all kinds of defence materials and ... have sent weapons that we have told you about but it is also true that we have to consider very carefully what we do concretely and definitely warplanes are not part of that” Scholz said at a news conference in Berlin. He was speaking alongside Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who is on a diplomatic tour of Europe.
