People leaving Russia limited to carrying $10000 as sanctions bite Russian residents are no longer allowed to leave the country with more than the equivalent of $10000 as the Kremlin tries to keep capital inside the country. The rule affects the movement of foreign currency too and seems designed to make sure that people attempting to leave Russia — as sanctions are slapped on the country — don’t take all of their hard currency with them. Long queues are now common at cash machines that still have bank notes as people try to withdraw their holdings against the backdrop of a rouble that is rapidly losing most of its value in light of the sanctions. Prices of imported goods are shooting up and people are trying to purchase some items like new phones before they become unaffordable. \ ‘ Russia's rouble has plummeted in value amid a flurry of Western sanctions [File: Alexey Malgavko/Reuters]
