No reason for martial law in Russia: Putin The Russian leader says there is nothing that warrants imposing martial law in Russia at this point. Putin’s comment followed days of speculation that the introduction of martial law could be imminent. The Russian president said that “martial law is imposed in a country ... in the event of external aggression including in specific areas of hostilities. But we don’t have such a situation and I hope we won't”.  Russian army military vehicles are seen in Armyansk Crimea [File: AFP]
