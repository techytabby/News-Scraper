Kyiv building residents in tears Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan reporting from in front of the struck residential building in Kyiv said emergency services were still going through the rubble. “You can still smell the burning” he said noting that the strike had destroyed both the front and back sides of the nine-storey structure. “Throughout the day we have seen people come back here in tears just looking at the building their homes that have been completely destroyed” added Khan. “It’s a residential area. There’s a football pitch [very close to the building] there’s no military target anywhere here.” At least three people were wounded in the shelling according to officials [AFP]
