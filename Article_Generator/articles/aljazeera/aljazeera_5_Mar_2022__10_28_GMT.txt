Zaporizhzhia a city ‘preparing for siege’ Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reporting from Dnipro said there are three points in Mariupol where buses are gathering for people to get on board to take them to the city of Zaporizhzhia located at least 300km (186 miles) to the north. “Zaporizhzhia is a city that can only really be described as preparing for siege itself — tank traps checkpoints thousands of civil defence volunteers in and around the city” Stratford said. “We know there are Russian forces around an hour even less than that south of Zaporizhzhia. “This corridor that is being set up will take people across country we understand northwest through rural areas.” )) Analyst: Russia yet to bring full military force to Ukraine ee) aadl Analyst: Russia not using full military force
