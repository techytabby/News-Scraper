Toyota suspends operations at Russian plant Japan's Toyota says it will suspend operations at its only factory in Russia and stop shipping vehicles to the country citing “supply chain disruptions” linked to Moscow’s assault on Ukraine. The carmaker said its Saint Petersburg plant produced about 80000 vehicles last year mainly for the Russian market and just a fraction of the 10.5 million Toyotas made worldwide.
