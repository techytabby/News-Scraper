Where are the Russian forces near Kyiv now? A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside Kyiv since last week appears to have dispersed according to a United States-based satellite-imaging company as the city braces for a possible ground assault. Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed. The assessment came as a senior US defence official said on Thursday that Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from the northwest had edged 5km (3 miles) closer to the city in the previous 24 hours placing them just 15km (9 miles) from its centre. Meanwhile a separate tranche of soldiers advancing on the capital from the northeast was about 40km (25 miles) from the city the official speaking on condition of anonymity added at a Pentagon news briefing. The official said the “multiple lines of advance towards Kyiv” indicate Moscow aims to encircle the city.
