Netflix halts service in Russia Streaming giant Netflix has suspended its service in Russia. A statement from the company cited “circumstances on the ground” for its decision to suspend its Russian service but did not offer any additional details. The US-based platform had already halted its acquisitions in Russia as well as its production of original programmes. Earlier social media giant TikTok announced it was suspending the posting of all video content from Russia in order to keep its employees safe and comply with new regulations in the country. Moscow on Friday signed into law a bill introducing jail terms of up to 15 years for what is deemed “fake news” about the Russian army. ALJAZEERA ""i oj ‘RUSSIA F 4 Media Crackdown
