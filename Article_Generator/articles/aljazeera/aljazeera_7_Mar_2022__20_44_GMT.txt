UK refuses to drop visa requirement for Ukraine refugees Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rejected calls for the United Kingdom to ease visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees fleeing conflict. “We are a very very generous country. What we want though is control and we want to be able to check.” Johnson told reporters. “I think it’s sensible given what's going on in Ukraine to make sure that we have some basic ability to check who is coming in.” The British government has been criticised for requiring refugees to first acquire a visa leaving some Ukrainians stranded in the French city of Calais.
