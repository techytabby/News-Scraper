‘Your courage inspires us all’: Trudeau tells Zelenskyy Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has praised Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his courage and leadership as the Ukrainian president addressed Canada’s parliament. “Your courage and the courage of your people inspires us all. You're defending the right of Ukrainians to choose their own future and in doing so you're defending the values that form the pillars of all free democratic countries” Trudeau said before Zelenskyy’s virtual address which garnered multiple standing ovations in the House of Commons in Ottawa. “With allies and partners we're imposing crippling sanctions to ensure Putin and his enablers in Russia and Belarus are held accountable. We have imposed severe sanctions on 15 new Russian officials including government and military elites who are complicit in this illegal war.”
