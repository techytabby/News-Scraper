‘Putin won't stop’: Ex-Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Fedorov a former deputy foreign minister of Russia told Al Jazeera Russian President Vladimir Putin’s objective is to surround Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and then give President Volodomyr Zelenskyy an ultimatum. “He declared a very clear goal that Ukraine as it is today should be changed” Fedorov said from Moscow. “I’ve known him for many years he will not stop. Most probably in the next 5-6 days the military operation will be extended to much more territory including Odesa” he predicted. “The Russian army will surround Kyiv and then there will be a kind of ultimatum for maybe 24 hours for Zelenskyy to resign for the government to resign to declare something like an interim government or something like this because from military point of view it’s very dangerous to start a military attack on Kyiv - it can bring a lot of damages” Fedorov added. “Also let’s not forget that Kiev is playing a very important role in Russia’s history; in Russia it’s called the mother of all Russian cities.”
