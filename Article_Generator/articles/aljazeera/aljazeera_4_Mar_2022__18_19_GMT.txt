Russian envoy dismisses reports of attack on nuclear plant Moscow’s envoy to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya has dismissed reports that Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as “lies” and “disinformation”. “You're trying to present the situation in such a way as though the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was allegedly shelled by the Russian military as a result of which a fire broke out” Nebenzya told the UN Security Council. “These statements are simply untrue.” Nebenzya said Ukrainian “saboteurs” fired at Russian forces from a training facility outside the power plant early on Friday. “The Russian patrol returned fire on the firing points of the Ukrainian saboteurs in the building of the training complex and suppressed their fire. As they were leaving the Ukrainian sabotage group set fire to the training facility” Nebenzya said. He stressed that Russian forces are not interfering with the work of the plant’s operators but are trying to ensure the security of the facility.
