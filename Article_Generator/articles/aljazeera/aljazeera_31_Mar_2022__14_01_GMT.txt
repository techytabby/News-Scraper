Putin says Russian gas must be paid for in roubles from Friday Putin says he has signed a decree saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday and contracts would be halted if these payments were not made. “In order to purchase Russian natural gas they must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow” the Russian leader said in televised remarks. “If such payments are not made we will consider this a default on the part of buyers with all the ensuing consequences. Nobody sells us anything for free and we are not going to do charity either — that is existing contracts will be stopped.”
