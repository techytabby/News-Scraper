Satellite photos show break-up of Russian convoy outside Kyiv Satellite photos have shown that a massive Russian convoy that had been mired outside the Ukrainian capital since last week appeared to have dispersed. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed the 64-kilometre (40-mile) line of vehicles tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed with armoured units seen in towns near the Antonov airport north of the city. Some of the vehicles have moved into forests Maxar reported. The convoy had massed outside the city early last week but its advance appeared to have stalled amid reports of food and fuel shortages. US officials said Ukrainian troops also targeted the convoy with anti-tank missiles.  oe SL e A satellite image shows troops and equipment deployed amid Russia's continuing invasion of Ukraine in Ozera northeast of Antonov airport Ukraine [Maxar Technologies/Handout via Reuters]
