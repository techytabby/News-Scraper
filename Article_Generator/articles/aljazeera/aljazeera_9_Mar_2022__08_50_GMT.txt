Ukraine makes new attempt to get civilians out of Mariupol other cities Ukraine will try to evacuate civilians through six humanitarian corridors the country’s deputy prime minister has said. Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement that Ukrainian armed forces had agreed to stop firing in those areas from gam until 9pm local time (07:00-19:00 GMT) and urged Russian forces to fulfil their commitment to local ceasefires. She added the corridors will go from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia; Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia; Sumy to Poltava; Izyum to Lozova; Volnovakha to Pokrovske; and from several towns around Kyiv which she identified as Vorzel Borodyanka Bucha Irpin and Hostomel to the capital. “T appeal to the Russian Federation: You have undertaken official public commitments to cease fire ... We have had negative experiences when the commitments that were undertaken did not work” Vereshchuk said. There have been several failed attempts to open safe exit routes for trapped civilians in the past few days with Kyiv and Moscow blaming one another for the failures.
