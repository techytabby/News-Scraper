UN refugee chief: ‘We need a ceasefire’ Speaking to Al Jazeera from Korezowa at the Ukrainian-Polish border where he met arriving refugees UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi has welcomed the announcement about the opening of humanitarian corridors but said that was not enough. “We need more than that” he said. “We need a ceasefire we need a cessation of hostilities so that people can stop moving and even go back to their homes perhaps but under the circumstances they are all telling me they are afraid too much.” Grandi said it was “very difficult” to listen to the refugees’ stories. “Days and days of travel in the cold from their bombed cities to seek safety here in Poland I saw the same in Moldova Romania it’s all over but Poland is taking the brunt of this enormous avalanche of people” he said. Grandi lamented that the war had now caused more than 1.5 million to flee Ukraine adding that all signs indicated that the flow of people would increase in the coming days. “What we hear is that hundreds of thousands are on the move” he said. “If bombs continue to rain on cities people will leave” he added.
