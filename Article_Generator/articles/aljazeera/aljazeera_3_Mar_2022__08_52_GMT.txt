Why is Kherson strategically important? Kherson strategically located at the mouth of the Dnieper River’s exit into the Black Sea is the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion. Control of the city which is home to about 300000 people is important because it could allow Moscow to mass troops there and use it as a launching post to push its forces further inland.
