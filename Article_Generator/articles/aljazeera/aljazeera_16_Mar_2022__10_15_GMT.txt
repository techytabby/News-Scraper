Zelenskyy to seek more help in speech to US Congress Zelenskyy is set to make an urgent appeal to the US Congress for more help in fending off the Russian invasion. The president's virtual address to members of the House of Representatives and Senate scheduled for 9am local time (13:00 GMT) comes a day after he made a plea to Canada’s parliament for more Western sanctions on Russia and the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Ano-fly zone is a step that US President Joe Biden and NATO allies have resisted out of a fear of escalating the war that began with Russia’s February 24 invasion. Biden on Tuesday signed into law $13.6bn in emergency aid to Ukraine to help it obtain more weaponry and for humanitarian assistance.
