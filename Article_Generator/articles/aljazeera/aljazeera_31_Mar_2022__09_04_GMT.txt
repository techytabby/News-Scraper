‘Hundreds’ of South Ossetians fighting in Ukraine: ex-separatist leader The former leader of South Ossetia a breakaway province in ex-Soviet Georgia said “hundreds of fighters” have joined Russian forces in Ukraine complaining they were treated as “cannon fodder”. “T don’t doubt that the boys who already returned home could go back to the special operation zone and help complete the liberation of Donbas IF THEY FIND IT NECESSARY” Eduard Kokoity wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the 1990s. Its leaders said Georgia’s post-Soviet nationalist government violated the rights of Ossetians to use their language that is distantly related to Farsi. Russia fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 and recognised the “independence” of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It now has large military bases there.
