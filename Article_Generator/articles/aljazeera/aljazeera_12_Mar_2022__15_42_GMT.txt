‘Around 1300’ Ukrainian troops killed since Russia invasion: Zelenskyy “Around 1300” Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia’s invasion started Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian president made the disclosure at a media briefing the first time Kyiv had given such a toll since the beginning of fighting. The UN so far has reported at least 1546 civilian casualties including 564 killed but it believes such figure “is likely much higher” as many reports are still pending corroboration.
