Hundreds in Tokyo protest Hundreds of people have marched in Tokyo protesting against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The crowd shouted “Stop war. Protect lives.” Some held signs that read: “We stand with Ukraine.” Others held images of Putin with the words: “Stop Putin.” Russia’s shelling of a nuclear plant in Ukraine on Friday and Putin’s implied threat of nuclear war have struck a nerve in Japan which suffered atomic attacks at the end of World War II in Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well as the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl in Fukushima in 2011.
