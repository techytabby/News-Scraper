Not clear if nuclear site safe: Former IAEA official Speaking from Vienna Austria a former IAEA official told Al Jazeera it was not yet clear if the Zaporizhzhia facility was secure. “We can’t really tell if its [nuclear plant] is safe or not especially if the operators of the nuclear power plant are sitting at their desk with Russian soldiers with guns behind them. “According to the state nuclear regulatory inspector of Ukraine which is ... responsible for the safe operation of nuclear power plants ... has pointed out that many of these operators have been working very long shifts and have not had rest” Tariq Rauf said. “Therefore they may not be in a position to properly monitor the control room and to monitor the reactor that is running” he added.
