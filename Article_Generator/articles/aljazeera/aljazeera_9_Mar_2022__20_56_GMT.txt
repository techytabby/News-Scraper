Pentagon does not support more jets for Ukraine US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has informed his Polish counterpart that Washington does not back Warsaw’s plans to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby has said. He said the effectiveness of Russia’s “significant” air force has already been limited by Ukraine’s air defences. “Polish generosity is clearly on display for the whole world to see” Kirby said. “But at this time we believe that provision of additional fighter aircraft provides little increased capabilities at high risk.” He added that transferring the jets to Ukraine would risk an escalation with Russia.
