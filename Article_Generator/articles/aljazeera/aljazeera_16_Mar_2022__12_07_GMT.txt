Ukraine rejects Russian neutrality proposals in peace talks Ukraine has said it wants its security to be guaranteed by international forces and rejected proposals pushed by Russia for it to adopt a neutral status comparable to Austria or Sweden. “Ukraine is now in a direct state of war with Russia. As a result the model can only be ‘Ukrainian’ and only on legally verified security guarantees” its top negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak said in comments published by Zelensky’s office.
