Lions and tigers driven out of Ukraine to safety in Polish zoo A truck carrying six lions six tigers two caracals and an African wild dog from a sanctuary east of Kyiv reached Poland on Thursday after a two-day drive to escape the Russian invasion a Polish zoo official said. The owner of the sanctuary had asked for help from Poznan zoo in western Poland to get the animals to safety. “They had to go a long way around to avoid Zhytomyr and other bombardment zones. They had to turn back many times because all the roads were blown up full of holes impossible to pass with such cargo which is why it took so long” said Poznan zoo spokesperson Malgorzata Chodyla.
