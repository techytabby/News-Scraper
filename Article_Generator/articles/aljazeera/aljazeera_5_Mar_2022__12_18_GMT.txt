Blinken visits Poland as Russia’s war in Ukraine intensifies US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine. Blinken was in the city of Rzeszow for talks with top Polish officials and was to go to a frontier post to meet Ukrainian refugees later in the day. Blinken met Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau a day after attending a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels at which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members like Poland.
