US speeds licensing for gun ammunition shipments to Ukraine The US is rapidly processing requests from Americans to export firearms and ammunition to Ukraine the US commerce department has said. The department said it had imposed export controls on Russia to “degrade its ability to sustain military aggression” and Americans should check agency regulations to see if a licence was needed to ship specific firearms to Ukraine. “The department has been processing requests rapidly for the export of firearms and ammunition to Ukraine under its existing processes and authorities” a department spokesperson said. Americans are donating thousands of sets of body armour and millions of rounds of ammunition in response to Ukraine’s pleas for military support.
