‘No-fly zone’ means NATO would have to directly engage Russia: Ex-US official A former US deputy assistant secretary of state has said that imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine could drag NATO and Western nations into a direct confrontation with Russia. Joel Rubin’s comments came after NATO earlier rejected calls from Ukrainian leaders to enforce a no-fly zone amid Russia’s continued attacks on the country. “It’s not just a call for a no-fly zone and then aircraft cease. What this would mean is that NATO would be directly engaging Russian military aircraft and if the aircraft were to fly NATO would be obligated to shoot them down. So that’s what we're talking about here. It’s a horrible conundrum” Rubin told Al Jazeera. “NATO is part of that puzzle in trying to push back against Russia and to get Vladimir Putin to back off” Rubin added. “He needs to pull back accept a negotiated outcome and stop killing innocent civilians in Ukraine.”
