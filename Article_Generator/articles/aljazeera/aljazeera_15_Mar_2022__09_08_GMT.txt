Ukraine claims ‘more than 13500’ Russian servicemen killed Ukraine claims to have killed “more than 13500” Russian servicemen since the invasion began on February 24. The General Staff of the Armed Forces said that 404 Russian tanks 1279 armoured vehicles 81 planes and 95 helicopters have been “destroyed”. In a Facebook post it added that the figures are being updated and the verification is “complicated” by the high intensity of the fighting. Russia’s Defense Ministry has reported the death toll only once on March 2 saying that 498 servicemen had died in Ukraine — and claiming that 2870 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 12 that 1400 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed. There is no way to verify the claims of both sides.
