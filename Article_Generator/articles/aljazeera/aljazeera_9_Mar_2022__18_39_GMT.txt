Putin rejected every US ‘off-ramp’ in conflict: Blinken US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Putin rejected every off- ramp offered by the United States to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine. “We've sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He’s the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far every time there’s been an opportunity to do just that he’s pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he’s been pursuing” Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss. “Tf he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine it will be a long bloody drawn-out mess” he added.
