Lavrov says Russia aiming to disarm Ukraine In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said “Ukraine has the capability and the technology to manufacture a nuclear weapon... The mission is clear: to disarm Ukraine and not deploy and manufacture any weapons that threaten Russia’s security.” Lavrov added Russia had made its requests clear. “President Putin has repeatedly expressed our position which our delegation conveyed in the talks with Ukraine in Belarus: Crimea is part of Russia; recognising the Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics within the borders of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk; the eradication of Nazism as was the case with Nazi Germany” he said.
