Warning of radiation risk amid power outage at Chernobyl Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company has warned that radioactive substances could be released from the Chernobyl plant because it cannot cool spent nuclear fuel after its power connection was severed. Energoatom said in a statement that it had not been possible to carry out work to restore power to the site which has been occupied by Russian troops because of fighting in the area. Any warming of the approximately 20000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl could lead to “the release of radioactive substances into the environment” it added. “The radioactive cloud could be carried by wind to other regions of Ukraine Belarus Russia and Europe” Energoatom said.
