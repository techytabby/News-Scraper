French minister: Room for further sanctions against Russia France and Europe still have margin for manoeuvre to implement further sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said. “Yes there are margins for manoeuvre. All options are on the table” Le Maire told BFMTV and RMC Radio. The 27-nation European Union has imposed three packages of sanctions on Moscow over its aggression on Ukraine including freezing Russian central bank assets and disconnecting seven Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system.
