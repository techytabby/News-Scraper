Hungary opposes ban on Russian energy Viktor Orban Hungary’s prime minister has opposed a ban on Russian oil and gas saying it “would represent a disproportionately large burden” for his country. “While we condemn Russia’s armed offensive and we also condemn the war we will not allow Hungarian families to be made to pay the price of the war; and so the sanctions must not be extended to the areas of oil and gas” he said in a statement.
