Putin unlikely to be able to install puppet gov't in Kyiv: CIA chief Putin’s assumptions about Ukraine before the invasion turned out to be “profoundly flawed” CIA director William J Burns has said. “T fail to see — and our analysts fail to see — how we could sustain a puppet regime or a pro-Russian leadership that he tries to install in the face of what is a massive opposition from Ukrainian people” Burns said. The CIA chief predicted an “ugly next few weeks” of fighting as Putin doubles down with force amid Ukrainian resistance. “The one thing I’m absolutely convinced of and I think our analysts across the intelligence committee are absolutely convinced of is the Ukrainians are going to continue to resist fiercely and effectively” Burns told US lawmakers.
