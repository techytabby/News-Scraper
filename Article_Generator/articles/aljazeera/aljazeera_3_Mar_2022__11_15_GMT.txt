Kuleba says Putin has ‘no chance of winning’ highlights Zaporizhzhia plant workers Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called Moscow’s military onslaught a “People’s War for Ukraine” highlighting an image of Ukrainian civilians blocking Russian troops from accessing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in the southeastern city of Enerhodar as evidence of the country’s resolve. “This is a true People’s War for Ukraine. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has no chance of winning it” Kuleba tweeted. Footage posted online on Wednesday appeared to show that dozens of local residents and workers at the plant the largest of its kind in Europe had barred access to the facility as Russian forces advanced in the region. Meanwhile the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Moscow had on Monday informed Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi that Russian military forces had taken control of the territory around the plant. As of Thursday lunchtime it was not immediately clear if the facility was still being blocked or who was in control of the site.
