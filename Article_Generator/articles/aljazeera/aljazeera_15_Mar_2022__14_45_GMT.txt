Macron to raise with Putin ‘protection’ for journalist who protested on TV French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will offer protection to a Russian journalist facing a long prison sentence after she brandished on live TV a slogan protesting the invasion of Ukraine. “We will launch diplomatic efforts aiming to offer [her] protection — either at the embassy but also protection through asylum. I will have the chance at my next talks with President Putin to propose this solution in a very direct and concrete manner” Macron said on a visit to the Loire region of western France.
