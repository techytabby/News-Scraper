Correspondent: Strong smell of explosives in Kyiv Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen reporting from Kyiv said there is a smell of explosions and explosives in the city as Russian forces advance. “[The smell is] really strong; it’s getting closer in the last days and even hours. You hear a lot more artillery fire shelling; it’s mainly been coming from the northwest a town called Irpin. There’s been heavy fighting for days [there] already” Vaessen said. “[Irpin] is basically the entrance into the capital so it’s a very strategic point for the Ukrainian army and towns around Irpin have already fallen in Russian hands. Irpin is very much the last point before Russian forces can enter the capital. “Also on the northwest flank of the capital you can see that Russian forces are closing in ... There was a huge bombardment this morning; eight rockets were fired at an air base in the south so it’s very much a sense here that there’s going to be an encirclement around the capital. We don’t know when ... no one knows how fast Russian forces are advancing.”
