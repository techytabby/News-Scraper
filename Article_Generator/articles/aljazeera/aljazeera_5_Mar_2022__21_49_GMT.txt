‘Relentless’ Russian shelling in Mariupol: Mayor Russian forces have intensified shelling in the port city of Mariupol including the use of planes to bomb residential areas Mayor Vadym Boychenko says. Boychenko said thousands of children women and the elderly came under fire as they arrived in the morning for a possible evacuation. Russia had promised to stop shelling Mariupol and Volnovakha in the east to allow the evacuation but it accused Ukrainian forces of violating the ceasefire. Capturing Mariupol which has been fending off the attack for six days could allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
