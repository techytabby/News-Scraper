Humanitarian situation ‘catastrophic’ in Mariupol: MSF Asenior official from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has warned that the humanitarian situation in the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol is “catastrophic” and it is vital that civilians be evacuated. “It is imperative that this humanitarian corridor which could have been created today but which has not really been put in place following non- respect of the ceasefire is put in place very quickly to allow the civilian population women and children to get out of this city” MSF’s emergency coordinator in Ukraine Laurent Ligozat told the AFP news agency. He said a lack of drinking water food electricity and heating is becoming critical in the city.
