Who are the volunteer fighters referred to by Russia? Putin has said Russia should allow volunteer fighters from Syria and other countries to join Moscow-backed separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there had been been “more than 16000 applications” from potential recruits mostly from the Middle East. Many of them were individuals who had fought alongside Russian forces in the battle against the ISIL (ISIS) group he claimed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed that the potential recruits include fighters from Syria. Damascus is a staunch ally of Moscow which intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015 to support President Bashar al-Assad turning the tide of the conflict in his favour.
