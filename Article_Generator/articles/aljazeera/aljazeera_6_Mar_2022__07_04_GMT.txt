UK intelligence: Russia targeting populated areas British military intelligence says Russian forces were targeting populated areas in Ukraine but that the strength of resistance slowed their advance. “The scale and strength of Ukrainian resistance continue to surprise Russia” it said in an update adding that Moscow “has responded by targeting populated areas in multiple locations including Kharkiv Chernihiv and Mariupol.” “Russia has previously used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016 employing both air and ground-based munitions” the update said. Moscow has repeatedly denied that it is targeting civilian areas.
