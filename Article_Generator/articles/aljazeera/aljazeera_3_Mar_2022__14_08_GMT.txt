No breakthrough expected at upcoming talks: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine says there is little hope the upcoming second round of talks will produce any agreement on ending the war. “If anything there has been an escalation since they last met on Monday [and] on that occasion they begged to differ massively on the issues there was no common ground” Simmons said. “Some sort of move towards a confidence-building measure would be probably the best possible outcome of these talks right now” he added. “There is a call from Ukraine to prioritise a ceasefire but the problem is Russia is saying that they wish to demilitarise Ukraine and really that stops any dialogue progressing so it is hard to see how they will come out of this round of talks with any form of real progress.”
