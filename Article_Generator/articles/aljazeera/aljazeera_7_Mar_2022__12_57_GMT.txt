Russia sustaining ‘huge losses’: Analyst The military situation in Ukraine did not change radically over the weekend according to Nikolay Mitrokhin a Russia expert and researcher at Germany's Bremen University. Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera there had been limited Russian attacks near the key southeastern port city of Mariupol and in the eastern region of Luhansk and Ukrainian counterattacks near the northeastern city of Kharkiv. “There is a general feeling that after 12 days of fighting both sides exhausted their resources” he said. Some of Russia’s vehicles — including tanks and armoured personnel carriers — have become stuck in heavy mud or have run out of fuel Mitrokhin added. Amid the issues Moscow is now concentrating more forces on the Ukrainian border ready for a second offensive he said. Meanwhile Ukraine’s military equipment is scattered nationwide Mitrokhin added. But while Ukraine has tens of thousands of battle-tested servicemen and volunteers to call on Russia “faces a crisis with decent infantry” he said. “There aren't many cadres with combat experience” Mitrokhin added noting that Moscow was sustaining “huge losses”.
