Reports of ‘heavy casualties’ in Mariupol: AJE correspondent Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reporting from Zaporizhzhia a cit southeastern Ukraine says there are reports of “heavy casualties” in Mariupol a key port city in the country’s south. “The mayor ... is alleging that Russian forces are blocking the exit of civilians from the city” Stratford said. “We know that there was a large tank column and a lot of Russian weapons moved into positions to the west of the city over the last couple of days” he added. “We also know that there has been a lot of shelling on the east of the city as well since this war started.” Stratford said the Russians appeared to be “desperately trying to create a land corridor” linking the northern part of the Crimean Peninsula which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 with the self-proclaimed Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “And it certainly looks as if there has been so far today what can only be described as an escalation as Russia tries to push further forwards in multiple locations around the country” he added. ‘Stop the war’ say Ukrainian students
