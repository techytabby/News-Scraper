Ukraine says Russia's stance on humanitarian corridors ‘completely immoral’ Ukraine has slammed as “completely immoral” Russia's stance on humanitarian corridors after Moscow suggested it would allow people to flee Ukrainian cities provided they exited to Belarus or Russia. A spokesman for Zelenskyy said Ukrainian citizens should be allowed to leave their homes through Ukrainian territory and accused Russia of deliberately hampering previous evacuation attempts. “This is a completely immoral story. People’s suffering is used to create the desired television picture” the spokesman said in a written message. “These are citizens of Ukraine they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine.”
