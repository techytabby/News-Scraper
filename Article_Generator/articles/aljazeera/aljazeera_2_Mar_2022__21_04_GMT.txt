Pentagon says Russian advance on Kyiv ‘remains stalled’ Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the Russian military’s push towards Kyiv from the north “remains stalled”. “They haven't — from our best estimates — have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking in the last 24 to 36 hours” Kirby told reporters. He said the Pentagon believes the advance has slowed down because Russian forces are deliberately regrouping while also facing unanticipated logistic challenges and experiencing resistance from Ukrainians.
