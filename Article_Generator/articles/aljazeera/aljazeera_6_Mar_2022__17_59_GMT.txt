Battles ongoing on Kyiv's outskirts Russian and Ukrainian forces are locked in a long-range shelling war along the outskirts of the capital Kyiv putting towns including Hostomel and Irpin in the line of fire. Several buildings in Hostomel were on fire after being hit by air strikes. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces claim to control the area. In the nearby town of Irpin residents fled their homes after buildings were severely damaged. Civilians tried to get to the remains of a bridge leading to Kyiv over the Irpin River which Ukrainian forces blew up last week to stall the Russian advance. Civilians continue to flee from Irpin due to ongoing Russian attacks. [Emin Sansar/Anadolu Agency]
