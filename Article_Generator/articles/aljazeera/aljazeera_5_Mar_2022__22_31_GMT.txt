Ukrainian negotiator: Russia realising ‘real cost of war’ Talks with Russia are becoming “constructive” a Ukrainian negotiator said describing what he sees as a shift in Moscow’s attitude towards Ukrainian resistance and biting international sanctions. “At the very start of the war they were insisting on total domination. They weren't expecting that Ukraine would deliver such severe resistance” Mykhailo Podolyak told The Globe and Mail. “They are starting to realise the real price of war only now. And now we are starting to have constructive negotiations” added the official who participated in the first two rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine. A third session of talks is scheduled for Monday according to the Ukrainian delegation.
