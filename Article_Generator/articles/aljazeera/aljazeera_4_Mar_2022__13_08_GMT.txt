NATO chief warns of ‘more deaths and suffering’ to come NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned the war in Ukraine will lead to more deaths and destruction over the coming days as he appealed to Putin to withdraw all Russian troops without conditions. “The days to come are likely to be worse with more deaths more suffering and more destruction” Stoltenberg told reporters after a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. But he ruled out sending NATO troops to Ukraine or setting up a no- fly zone over the country as has been requested by Kyiv amid fears such moves would draw the alliance into a direct military confrontation with Russia. “Allies agree we should not have NATO planes operating in Ukrainian air space or NATO troops on Ukraine’s territory” Stoltenberg said.
