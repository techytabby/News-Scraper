Ukraine claims Russia has attacked a chemical plant Ukraine's prosecutor general claimed Monday that a Russian shell has hit a chemical plant in Sumy causing a leak in a 50-ton tank of ammonia that took hours to contain. Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said the leak spread 1.5 miles in all directions from the Sumykhimprom plant according to the Associated Press. The plant is on the eastern outskirts of the city which has a population of about 263000 and has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks.
