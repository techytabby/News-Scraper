Lavrov: Russia China cooperation ‘will only get stronger’ Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted Saturday that cooperation between Russia and China will only improve as the West continues to “undermine” relations between the two countries. “This cooperation will get stronger because at a time when the West is blatantly undermining all the foundations on which the international system is based of course we - as two great powers - need to think how to carry on in this world"" Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying. China has reportedly considered providing military support to Russia after already aligning itself to provide economic relief from the crippling sanctions enacted by other countries.
