Biden says Ukraine has enough ‘sophisticated equipment’ President Biden attempted to dispel the belief that Ukraine is fighting Russia without sophisticated equipment arguing they have what they need to effectively fight the invasion. “The idea that they don't have enough sophisticated equipment is just simply not accurate.” Biden said during remarks at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting Monday. ""They have every piece of equipment that makes rational sense based on our military and NATO's military for them to be able to do what they're doing. They're wreaking havoc on the on the Russian military whether its their tanks or their helicopters or their aircraft.” Biden's comments come as many have continued for the U.S. to allow for the transfer of MiG fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine a move the administration has not backed down from arguing is too risky to be perceived as escalatory by the Russians.
