Ukraine claims Russia forcing civilians to evacuate to Rus: Ukraine accused Russia of forcing nearly half a million civilians from battered Ukrainian cities to Russia where Ukrainian officials fear they could be held hostage and used to pressure the government to give up their defense of the country. Ukraine claims that the Russians have taken 402000 people which includes 84000 children to Russia against their will according to reporting from the Associated Press. But Russia claims that the people it has evacuated to Russian territory wanted to be in Russia noting that many of the people are from predominately Russian-speaking regions that have been controlled by rebel groups since 2014. &
