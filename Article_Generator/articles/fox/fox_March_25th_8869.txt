Russia issues ‘fictitious’ report claiming it has achieved main tasks of invasion's first stage: ISW The Institute for the Study of War released a report Friday that Russia is attempting to ‘adjust the war's narrative"" by claiming that its primary objective was to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk. Sergei Rudskoi first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff gave a briefing to Russian press summing up the first month of the Russian invasion on March 25"" the ISW report reads. ""Rudskol inaccurately claimed Russian forces have completed ‘the main tasks of the first stage of the operation’ falsely asserting that Russia has heavily degraded the Ukrainian military enabling Russia to focus on the ‘main goal! of capturing Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.’ The report states the Russians are “adjusting” the narrative because it is ""not achieving its objectives and is being forced to abandon large-scale offensive operations because of its own failures and losses as well as continuing skillful Ukrainian resistance.” The report added that Rudsko’s comments were likely aimed at the domestic Russian audience. The Kremlin has reiterated this justification for the war frequently as part of efforts to explain the invasion to its people and build or sustain public support for Putin and the war’ the report explained. ""Rudskoi's framing of the capture of the rest of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as the ‘main goal’ of the operation is in line with this ongoing information operation.” Posted by Anew Mack Mile a
