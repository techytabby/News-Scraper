Zelenskyy calls for more weapons to Ukraine Russia trade embargo Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday urged northern European leaders to send more weapons to his country and to institute a full trade embargo with Russia Zelenskyy made the pleas while talking with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) ~ a grouping of 10 north Atlantic countries designed to react quickly to international crises according to the Associated Press. It includes NATO members such as Britain and the Baltic states as well as non-NATO countries such as Sweden and Finland Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian military is rapidly using up weapons and other hardware that western nations have shipped to his country. “We have to acknowledge Russia as a rogue state and there has to be a trade embargo with Russia” he added. “This is something that we need and you need as well just like the rest of the world to make sure there is peace in Europe and Ukraine.” Zelenskyy also repeated his frustration with NATO over its refusal to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine as he addressed the JEF leaders meeting Tuesday in London.
