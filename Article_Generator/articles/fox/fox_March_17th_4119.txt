(Maxar Technologies via AP) Viacheslav Chaus the regional governor of the Chemihiv region said Thursday that the northern Ukrainian city has suffered ""colossal losses and destruction’ as a result of the Russian military's bombardment. Speaking to Ukrainian television Chaus said 53 bodies of those “killed by the Russian aggressor from the ground or from the air” have been delivered to morgues in Chernihiv over the past 24 hours according to the Associated Press. Chernihiv — which has a population of around 280000 — was the site Wednesday where the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said ""Russian forces shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread.” “The city has never known such nightmarish colossal losses and destruction” Chaus reportedly said Thursday.
