(Fox News) A senior U.S. defense official said Monday that Ukraine's military has recaptured the town of Trostyanets in the easter part of the country and are “slugging it out"" in Mariupol The development comes about an hour after Fox News' Trey Yingst reported that Ukraine's military reclaimed the town of Irpin outside of Kyiv. The official also said Russian's military pilots are ‘still showing risk averse behavior"" and if they have to go into Ukrainian airspace they are “only doing it for a short amount of time before they leave. Most of the cruise missile strikes that they're launching are coming from inside Russian or below Russian airspace’ the official continued. ""I mean it's remarkable what the Ukrainians have been able to do with the air defense systems that they have available to them And that's why we'te going to have to try to replenish them as best we can. The official added that the U.S. is seeing more Russian military activity in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. One of the things that we think they want to do is cut off the Donbas for the sake of cutting off the Ukrainian armed forces that are there pinning them down so they can't come to the defense of other places the official said.
