The fires have raised concern about the possible release of radiation from the plant where a 1986 explosion and fire sent radioactive emissions across large parts of Europe. But Strelets says radiation levels in the area are within the norms. Ukrainian officials had earlier accused Russian forces of deliberately setting the fires or causing them with artillery shelling The Associated Press contributed to this report. Posted by Fox News a
