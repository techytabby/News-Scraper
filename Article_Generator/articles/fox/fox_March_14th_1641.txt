Congress eyes MiG-29 fighter jet transfer as next White House pressure point A growing and bipartisan group in Congress is pushing President Biden to facilitate the transfer of Poland's MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine amid Russia's brutal invasion despite statements by the U.S. military that such a move would be high-tisk low-reward. The White House is leaning on that position from the military in its opposition to providing the jets including that Ukraine does not really need the aircraft. But Biden already ceded to pressure from Congress to take a tougher stance against Russia multiple times since the war started. And dozens more members from both parties Sunday called on the president to help Ukraine get its hands on the Polish fighter jets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is petitioning for. We the 58 members of the Problem Solvers Caucus urge continued U.S. commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine and the freedom of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion’ the moderate bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus (PSC) said Sunday. ""We strongly believe that the U.S. must provide additional defense materiel to Ukrainians protecting their nation.” The PSC went on to call on Biden to help give the Ukrainians Stinger missiles drones and Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets that Poland is offering to send to Ukraine.
