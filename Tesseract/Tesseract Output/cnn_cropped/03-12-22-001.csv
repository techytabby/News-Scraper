23,we know

26,“We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not

28,"Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on the state-run Channel One, according to Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news"
29,agency.
30,The warning could escalate the situation in Ukraine further.

32,"education and training, for Ukraine."
33,Aid includes small arms: A US administration official said the $200 million will provide “immediate military assistance
34,"to Ukraine"" and will include “anti-armor, anti-aircraft systems, and small arms in support of Ukraine's front-line defenders facing"

37,authority or budgetary appropriations.

39,"More military equipment needed in Ukraine: On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded with allies for"

41,with just one country.”
42,He has repeatedly called for a no-fly zone to be imposed to stop Russian aircraft and for military planes to be sent to Ukraine.
43,US reluctant to escalate further: The US is concerned that more direct measures could escalate tensions with nuclear.

45,"The US and other NATO members have so far provided Ukraine with about 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 Stinger anti-"
