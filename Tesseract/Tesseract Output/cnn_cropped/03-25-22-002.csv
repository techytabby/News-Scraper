22,television
23,CNN reported earlier that Ukrainian forces appeared to have retaken territory around the small settlement of Lukianovka about 55
24,kilometers (about 34 miles) east of the capital. Social media geolocated by CNN depicted the aftermath of heavy battles there.
25,"To the immediate northwest of Kyiv, the mayor of Irpin told CNN that 80% of the town was controlled by the Ukrainian army, but"
26,added it was still coming under sustained fire from Russian Grad rockets.
27,"“Very serious battles took place near Baryshivka [to the east], Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin [all to the northwest]. We managed to"
28,"recapture quite a lot,” Denysenko said."
29,"Defensive lines were being held, he said, with counter-offensives staged."
30,"“Twelve tanks, several planes, more than 10 units of armored vehicles and at least 300 people were destroyed in the last 24"
31,"hours,” he said"
32,"At the same time, Denysenko reported further Russian airstrikes to the south of the capital, near Vasylkiv, which is about 30"

41,"The US has assessed that Russian forces are running low on air-launched cruise missiles, and there are indications they are trying"
42,"to preserve that inventory as part of their declining stocks of precision guided munitions, according to a US defense official."
43,"Air-launched cruise missiles are the “lowest” part of the inventory, the official added"
44,"In addition, these missiles are showing high failure rates at launch, the official said. The US currently assesses Russian failure rates"
45,"of precision guided munitions, especially cruise missiles failure rates, range from “20 percent to as high as 60 percent,” the official"
46,"said, depending on the type of weapon and mission."
47,"The US has tracked this information in part by observing the number of Russian missions that appear to involve unguided, or"
48,"""dumb,"" bombs. Satellites and other airborne intelligence platforms can monitor the failure of some missile launches by gathering"

69,"The US government believes they still ""retain the capacity"" to impose further non-military costs on Russia, like additional sanctions,"
70,"over the Kremlin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force"
71,One on Friday.
72,"""We believe that we still retain the capacity to impose additional costs on Russia that are not strictly military costs,"" Sullivan said"
73,"""We believe that, of course, there are additional measures to tighten the screws on sanctions and we'll be constantly reviewing"
74,"those."""
75,"""we do think the sanctions will increasingly have the effect of pressuring and constraining the Russian economy, the Russian"
76,war machine in ways that will shape their thinking as they go forward. And that will undermine their capacity to play an
77,"aggressive role in the world, as they have done over the course of the past many years,"" he added."
78,Sullivan also stressed the importance of enforcing the already announced sanctions.
79,"“This point about enforcement though, | think is really central because in the period ahead, Russia's main focus from an economic"
80,perspective is going to be to figure out how they can get around over or under the sanctions that have been imposed. And
81,blocking off those pathways is going to be vital to producing the kinds of cost imposition effects and vital to shaping the thinking in
82,"the Kremlin,"" Sullivan said."
83,When asked about concerns over sanctions backfiring and causing the Russian population to solidify behind Russian President
84,"Vladimir Putin, Sullivan acknowledged that it's a narrative the Russian government will try to push, but the US believes the Russian"
85,"people will be able to ""connect the dots.”"
86,"“at the end of the day, the Russian people are going to ask the more fundamental question of why this happened and how this"
87,"happened and we believe that at the end of the day they will be able to connect the dots,"" Sullivan said."
88,"When asked about whether the US is prepared to use secondary sanctions, Sullivan did not rule it out and said that the US is"
89,"ready to designate any person or company ""undertaking systematic efforts to weaken or evade them and those tools are at this"
90,point well understood by companies and countries around the world.”
91,"""We're prepared to use them if it becomes necessary to do so,"" Sullivan said."
92,"Regarding oil, Sullivan said that the administration is looking at “various actions” it can take alongside allies to address oil prices,"
93,saying it was a major topic of conversation when Biden met with G7 allies.
94,"Sullivan did not go into details, but hinted the actions would be announced soon, saying, “I will not steal the thunder of the"
95,administration on that issue.”
96,“That was a major topic of conversation. The question of what tools we have at our disposal to deal with global oil prices and
97,"without getting ahead of the administration we are looking at various actions we can take and I'll leave it at that for now,” Sullivan"

104,From CNN's All

107,chemical weapons in Ukraine.
108,"Asked about Biden's comments, Sullivan said Biden also said in Thursday's news conference that United States would respond"
109,“accordingly.”
110,“Meaning we will elect the form and nature of our response based on the nature of the action Russia takes and we'll do so in
111,coordination with our allies. And we've communicated to the Russians as the President said publicly a couple of weeks ago that
112,there will be a severe price if Russia uses chemical weapons. And | wont go beyond that other to say the United States has no
113,"intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstances,” Sullivan continued."
114,"Asked whether there is a consensus among allies for an “offramp” for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion, Sullivan"
115,"said that is the “wrong concept because, of course, this was a war Putin chose to wage, it's a war Putin could choose to stop at"
116,any moment.”
117,Sullivan said that a process is being conducted directly between the Ukrainians and the Russians as well as some communication
118,"between European allies like France and Germany, plus partners like Israel directly with the Russians."
119,"“The United States is not directly participating in those negotiations, but we're staying in close contact with our Ukrainian"
120,"counterparts and with those other countries that are talking to both sides,” Sullivan said, adding that “the President [was] very"

198,"Us President Joe Biden said on Thursday that NATO would respond if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, and has"
199,previously warned that Moscow would “pay a severe price” if it did so.
200,"The use of such weapons against Ukrainian people would mark a dramatic escalation to Russia's invasion, and would likely"
201,demand heavy retaliation from the West.
202,"But concerns have been growing that Russia may be planning to take the step, after the Kremlin planted the unsubstantiated idea"
203,"that Ukraine and the US may use these weapons. ""I's a tell that they themselves may be preparing to do so, and then trying to pin"
204,"the blame on someone else,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month"
205,Why would their use be so significant? Chemical weapons contain toxic substances designed to cause death or harm to their
206,"targets. They can spread dangerous chemicals including choking, blister and nerve agents, which can attack the body and cause"
207,"death on a vast scale, indiscriminately and across a wide area if they are deployed inside a bomb or an artillery shell."
208,"Their use is banned by international law. Russia has signed those treaties and claims it doesn't have chemical weapons, but the"
209,country has already been linked to the use of nerve agents against critics in recent years. Those cases include the poisonings of
210,"Alexander Litvinenko, Sergei Skripal and Alexey Navainy."
211,"A painful history: Widespread horror over the use of chemical agents during World War | resulted in the Geneva Protocol, signed"
212,"in 1925, which banned chemical weapons attacks."
213,"Nonetheless, as many as 25 countries worked to develop chemical weapons during the Cold War, according to the United Nations’"
214,Office for Disarmament Affairs. Lengthy negotiations eventually led to the adoption of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in
215,"1992, requiring nations to destroy their stockpiles and prohibiting the development, production or use of chemical weapons."
216,"There have, however, been limited occasions in which they have been used in combat -- and those occasions have led to political"
217,fallout around the world.
218,"Former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used a variety of chemical weapons against Iran during the 1980s, and their use in Syria"
219,over the past decade brought the threat of US intervention in that country’s civil war.
220,"Attacks in Ghouta in 2013, and in Khan Sheikhoun in 2017, both involved the alleged use of sarin gas, a nerve agent banned under"
221,the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.
