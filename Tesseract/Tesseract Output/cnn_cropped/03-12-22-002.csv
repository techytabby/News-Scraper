36,The Vatican is willing to do “everything possible” to assist in reaching a ceasefire and brokering an end to the war in Ukraine.

39,Parolin repeated Pope Francis’ appeal for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during a telephone conversation with Russian
40,Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week.
41,“| asked for an end to the fighting and for a negotiated solution to the conflict. | insisted on respect for the civilian population
42,"and on humanitarian corridors,” Parolin said, and he repeated the Pope's rejection of Moscow's claim that the war is a military"
43,"operation. “Words are important, and to define what is happening in Ukraine as a military operation is to fail to recognize the"
44,"reality of the facts. We are facing a war, which unfortunately claims many civilian victims, as all wars do.”"
45,The Pope's “unprecedented gesture” of visiting the Russian embassy to the Vatican the day after the invasion of Ukraine was a
46,"“personal step” in order to “express to the authorities in Moscow his concern about the escalation of the war,” Parolin said. War"
47,"is “madness,” he said, and appealed to the “consciences” of all people involved to cease fighting immediately."
48,"“We have before our eyes the terrible images coming from Ukraine. The victims among the civilians, women, elderly people,"
49,and defenseless children who have paid with their lives for the folly of war. The anguish grows as we see cities with gutted
50,"houses, no electricity, sub-zero temperatures, lack of food and medicine, as well as millions of refugees, mostly women and"
51,"children, fleeing the bombs. Over the last few days, | have come across a group of them, who have arrived in Italy from various"

83,From CNN's Chris Isidore
84,  
85,"As Russia's economy gets pummeled by increasingly severe western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine, the country's crucial"
86,airlines have been essentially cut off from much of the world.
87,But that is the least of the industry's problems. Russia's domestic airline industry could soon become a mere shell of its former
88,self due to restrictions on its operations
89,Sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union mean that the world's two major aircraft
90,"makers, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF), can no longer supply spare parts or maintenance support for Russian airlines. The"
91,same is true of jet engine makers.
92,"“within a year Russia will cease to have any kind of viable airline industry,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of"
93,AeroDynamic Advisory.
94,He said the country’s airline industry could soon find itself somewhere between the heavily sanctioned industries in Iran and
95,North Korea.
96,That poses a serious problem for Russia's overall economic activity.
97,"Russia is the world's largest nation by landmass, more than twice the size of the continental United States. It needs to have a"
98,"viable airline industry to keep its economy working, said Charles Lichfield, the deputy director of GeoEconomics Center at the"
99,"Atlantic Council, an international think tank."
100,“itis an important part of Russia's economy. They need that backbone. They need some basic domestic [airline] industry to
